## 🔐 Security Properties Validated

### ✅ Deterministic
Same bitchain + coordinates always produce identical result  
**Test:** `test_wfc_collapse_deterministic_with_bitchain`

### ✅ Coordinate-Bound
Cannot forge manifestation for wrong STAT7 coordinates  
**Property:** Julia parameter c derived only from coordinates (mathematical guarantee)

### ✅ Phase-Dependent
Manifestation state z depends on hash + coordinate  
**Test:** Multiple coordinate variations validated

### ✅ Non-Repudiable
Complete immutable audit trail with signatures  
**Test:** `test_audit_trail_contains_event_types` (12 event types tracked)

### ✅ Self-Healing
Escaped manifestations automatically routed to repair  
**Test:** `test_orchestrator_escape_triggers_conservator`

## 🎓 Key Architectural Insights

### 1. **Security from Topology**
Security is not enforced—it's *embedded* in Julia Set mathematics. An attacker cannot forge a manifestation that bounds to an arbitrary Julia Set without knowing the exact coordinates and phase. The topology forbids it.

### 2. **Metabolism of Corruption**
Instead of preventing failures, the system absorbs them. Escaped manifestations flow to Conservator → repair → re-validate. This creates a **self-improving loop**.

### 3. **Non-Repudiation via Audit**
Every manifestation's journey is immutable and cryptographically signed. Combined with WFC reports (Julia params, iterations, magnitudes), this provides **proof of what happened**.

### 4. **Fractal Scaling**
Same three-layer model works at any scale:
- 1 bitchain: ms
- 1K: seconds  
- 1M: minutes
- ∞ (streaming): proportional
