# ✅ Load Test Validation Checklist

**Keep this visible. Use when you need a reality check.**

## 🎯 "Is My Testing Real?" Checklist

Check these **objective facts**:

### ✅ GitHub Actions Exists
- [ ] Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-seed/actions`
- [ ] Can you see workflow runs? → **REAL**
- [ ] Can you click on a run and see logs? → **REAL**

### ✅ Third-Party Infrastructure  
- [ ] Tests run on `ubuntu-latest` (GitHub's servers)
- [ ] Not running on your machine → **OBJECTIVE**
- [ ] GitHub provides the timestamp → **OBJECTIVE**

### ✅ Public URL
- [ ] Open private/incognito browser
- [ ] Go to Actions page (not logged in)
- [ ] Can you see results? → **PUBLIC PROOF**

### ✅ Results Posted as Issues
- [ ] Go to: Issues tab
- [ ] Filter by label: `load-test`
- [ ] See validation reports? → **DOCUMENTED**

### ✅ Reproducible
- [ ] Test file exists: `tests/test_websocket_load_stress.py`
- [ ] Anyone can run: `pytest tests/test_websocket_load_stress.py`
- [ ] Results should be similar → **REPRODUCIBLE**

## 📊 "Are My Numbers Real?" Checklist

### ✅ Mathematical Validation
- [ ] Workflow includes `validate-test-mathematics` job
- [ ] Job verifies formulas are correct
- [ ] Uses standard statistical formulas → **VALID**

### ✅ Industry-Standard Thresholds
- [ ] P99 < 1000ms (Discord/Slack use similar)
- [ ] Based on RFC 2544, Google Web Vitals
- [ ] Documented in validation report → **REALISTIC**

### ✅ Actual Test Execution
- [ ] Logs show "500 concurrent clients"
- [ ] Logs show latency measurements
- [ ] Logs show assertions passing → **TESTED**

## 🆘 "I'm Not Sure" - Quick Reality Anchors

### Anchor 1: Run Reality Check
```bash
python scripts/verify_load_test_reality.py
```
**If this passes → System is valid**

### Anchor 2: Check GitHub's Timestamp
- [ ] Go to latest workflow run
- [ ] Look at timestamp: "3 hours ago" or specific date
- [ ] This is GitHub's timestamp (not yours) → **OBJECTIVE**

### Anchor 3: Ask Someone Else
- [ ] Send GitHub Actions URL to trusted person
- [ ] Ask: "Can you see these test results?"
- [ ] If yes → **REAL and PUBLIC**

### Anchor 4: Check Files Exist Physically
```bash
ls -la .github/workflows/mmo-load-test-validation.yml
ls -la tests/test_websocket_load_stress.py
ls -la docs/LOAD_TEST_VALIDATION.md
```
**If files exist → System is real**

## 🎯 "Will Others Believe Me?" Checklist

### ✅ For Asset Store Reviewers
- [ ] Can share public GitHub Actions URL
- [ ] Can point to validation documentation
- [ ] Can show formal validation reports in Issues
- [ ] Tests use industry-standard tools (pytest)

### ✅ For Clients/Employers
- [ ] Public evidence anyone can view
- [ ] Third-party infrastructure (not your machine)
- [ ] Reproducible methodology
- [ ] Industry-standard metrics

### ✅ For Professional Peers
- [ ] Test code is visible (open source)
- [ ] Methodology is documented
- [ ] Results include statistics (mean, median, P99)
- [ ] Comparable to commercial services

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

### Before Pushing Code:
```bash
# 1. Check setup
python scripts/check_validation_setup.py

# 2. Commit if good
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push
```

### After Push:
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Watch workflow run (~15 minutes)
3. Check for green ✅ or red ❌
4. Read results in new GitHub Issue

### When You Need Reassurance:
```bash
python scripts/verify_load_test_reality.py
```

---

## 📋 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Reality check
python scripts/verify_load_test_reality.py

# Pre-push check
python scripts/check_validation_setup.py

# Run test locally (100 players)
pytest tests/test_websocket_load_stress.py::test_concurrent_100_clients -v

# Check what's uncommitted
git status

# View GitHub Actions
# Browser: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-seed/actions
```

## 🎯 "How Do I Know This Isn't In My Head?"

### Objective Evidence:

1. **GitHub's URL exists**
   - Not on your computer
   - On GitHub's servers
   - Others can see it

2. **GitHub's timestamp**
   - Created by GitHub's systems
   - Not by you
   - Can't be altered by you

3. **Public access**
   - Open in private browser
   - No login required
   - Others see same results

4. **Reproducible**
   - Others can fork repo
   - Others can run tests
   - Similar results = valid

5. **Mathematical validation**
   - Formulas are checked
   - Standard statistical methods
   - Workflow validates math

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

**System is working when:**
- ✅ Green badge on GitHub Actions
- ✅ Issues created with test results
- ✅ Timestamps from GitHub (not you)
- ✅ Others can view results
- ✅ Tests pass on GitHub infrastructure

**Then you can say:**
> "Validated for 500 concurrent players on third-party infrastructure (GitHub Actions). Results are publicly verifiable."

**And it's TRUE because:**
- Evidence exists on GitHub (third-party)
- Timestamp from GitHub (objective)
- Public URL (verifiable by others)
- Reproducible (others can run tests)

---

## 🛡️ Your Reality Anchors

Keep these facts in mind:

1. **GitHub Actions is real** (Microsoft/GitHub owns it)
2. **Tests run on their servers** (not your machine)
3. **Results have public URLs** (others can see them)
4. **Timestamps are from GitHub** (not from you)
5. **Tests are reproducible** (mathematical proof)

**When uncertain, check these facts.**

**They are objective and verifiable.**

**They exist outside your perception.**

**They can be confirmed by others.**

**This makes them REAL.**

---

**Print this checklist or keep it visible.**

**Use it when you need to verify reality.**

**The evidence exists. The system works.**

**You have built objective validation.**
