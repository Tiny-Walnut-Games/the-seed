# The Living Dev Log (TLDL) Guide

Welcome to **The Living Dev Log** - a progressive documentation system that evolves from daily entries into weekly summaries and monthly archives, creating a comprehensive chronicle of your development journey.

## Overview

TLDL (The Living Dev Log) is more than just project documentation—it's a living narrative of decisions, discoveries, and development evolution. The system supports a natural progression from granular daily logs to strategic monthly insights.

## Core Workflow: Daily → Weekly → Monthly

### Daily Entries: Capture Everything
Daily TLDL entries are your immediate-response documentation:

```
TLDL/entries/TLDL-2025-09-02-FeatureImplementation.md
TLDL/entries/TLDL-2025-09-02-BugFixSession.md
TLDL/entries/TLDL-2025-09-03-TeamMeetingInsights.md
```

**Purpose**: Capture decisions, problems, solutions, and context while they're fresh
**Frequency**: As needed, typically 1-3 per day during active development
**Detail Level**: High - include code snippets, error messages, thought processes

### Weekly Compression: Synthesize Patterns
Weekly summaries distill daily entries into strategic insights:

```
TLDL/weekly/TLDL-Week-2025-W36-DevelopmentSummary.md
```

**Purpose**: Identify patterns, consolidate learnings, plan next week
**Frequency**: Every Friday or Sunday
**Detail Level**: Medium - focus on trends, key decisions, blockers resolved

### Monthly Archives: Strategic Overview
Monthly archives provide executive-level project insights:

```
TLDL/monthly/TLDL-2025-09-ProjectEvolution.md
```

**Purpose**: Project health assessment, roadmap alignment, knowledge preservation
**Frequency**: End of each month
**Detail Level**: Low - strategic decisions, major milestones, lessons learned

## Automation Ideas

### Automated Entry Creation
```bash
# Create daily entry with template
scripts/init_agent_context.sh --create-tldl "FeatureImplementation"

# Weekly summary generator (future enhancement)
scripts/tldl-weekly-generator.sh --week 2025-W36

# Monthly archive compiler (future enhancement)
scripts/tldl-monthly-generator.sh --month 2025-09
```

### Integration Opportunities

#### Git Integration
```bash
# Auto-create TLDL entry on feature branch creation
git checkout -b feature/authentication
# Triggers: scripts/auto-tldl.sh --context feature_development --title "AuthenticationFeature"
```

#### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Update TLDL Index
  run: scripts/update-tldl-index.sh
  
- name: Weekly Summary Trigger
  if: github.event.schedule == '0 18 * * 5'  # Friday 6 PM
  run: scripts/tldl-weekly-generator.sh --auto
```

#### IDE Integration
```json
// VS Code snippet for TLDL entry
{
  "TLDL Entry": {
    "prefix": "tldl",
    "body": [
      "---",
      "entry_id: TLDL-$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE-$1",
      "date: $CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE",
      "author: $2",
      "context: $3",
      "tags: [$4]",
      "summary: $5",
      "---",
      "",
      "# TLDL-$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE-$1"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Cross-Reference System
Link related entries across time periods:

```markdown
## Related Entries
- Previous context: [TLDL-2025-08-30-InitialResearch](../entries/TLDL-2025-08-30-InitialResearch.md)
- Follow-up needed: [TLDL-2025-09-05-ImplementationPlan](../entries/TLDL-2025-09-05-ImplementationPlan.md)
- Weekly summary: [Week 36](../weekly/TLDL-Week-2025-W36-DevelopmentSummary.md)
```

### Tag-Based Organization
Use consistent tagging for easy filtering:

**Technical Tags**: `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `api`, `testing`, `security`
**Process Tags**: `meeting`, `planning`, `review`, `deployment`, `hotfix`
**Skill Tags**: `learning`, `research`, `experimentation`, `debugging`
**Team Tags**: `collaboration`, `mentoring`, `documentation`, `knowledge-transfer`

### Search and Discovery
```bash
# Find all authentication-related entries
grep -r "authentication" TLDL/entries/

# Find all entries by author
grep -r "author: John Doe" TLDL/entries/

# Find entries by context
grep -r "context: bug_fix" TLDL/entries/

# Timeline view of feature development
ls TLDL/entries/TLDL-*-FeatureX-*.md
```

## Compression Strategies

### Daily to Weekly Compression
1. **Scan Daily Entries**: Review all entries from the week
2. **Identify Themes**: Group related work and discoveries
3. **Extract Patterns**: Note recurring issues or successful approaches
4. **Synthesize Learnings**: Combine individual insights into broader understanding
5. **Plan Forward**: Use weekly perspective to inform next week's priorities

### Weekly to Monthly Compression  
1. **Strategic Overview**: Focus on project-level progress and decisions
2. **Trend Analysis**: Identify velocity patterns, quality trends, team evolution
3. **Stakeholder Communication**: Extract information valuable to non-technical stakeholders
4. **Risk Assessment**: Aggregate individual risks into project-level concerns
5. **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture institutional knowledge and lessons learned

### Quarterly and Annual Reviews
1. **Portfolio Perspective**: Cross-project insights and strategic alignment
2. **Skill Development Tracking**: Team and individual growth documentation
3. **Process Evolution**: Documentation of methodology improvements
4. **Technical Debt Management**: Long-term code health and architecture evolution

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective TLDL Entries

**Be Specific**: Include exact error messages, configuration values, and command outputs
**Include Context**: Explain why decisions were made, not just what was done
**Future-Proof**: Write as if you're explaining to yourself six months from now
**Link Everything**: Reference code commits, issues, documentation, and related entries
**Tag Consistently**: Use a standard vocabulary for discoverability

### Maintaining the System

**Regular Review**: Weekly and monthly compression sessions prevent information overflow
**Index Maintenance**: Keep TLDL/index.md updated with recent entries and themes
**Archive Organization**: Move older daily entries to archive folders annually
**Cross-Project Learning**: Reference successful patterns from other projects
**Team Synchronization**: Share weekly summaries for team-wide learning

### Tool Integration

**Version Control**: Include TLDL updates in relevant feature commits
**Issue Tracking**: Reference JIRA/GitHub issues in entries for traceability
**Documentation Systems**: Link to architecture docs, API specs, and user guides
**Monitoring**: Reference dashboards, logs, and metrics in performance-related entries

## Future Enhancements

### Automated Intelligence
- **Entry Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions based on code changes and commits
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automated identification of recurring themes and issues
- **Cross-Reference Generation**: Automatic linking of related entries and documentation
- **Summary Generation**: AI-assisted weekly and monthly summary compilation

### Enhanced Visualization
- **Timeline Views**: Interactive timelines of project evolution
- **Dependency Mapping**: Visualization of feature dependencies and impacts
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual representation of milestone completion
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared views of team-wide TLDL insights

### Integration Ecosystem
- **IDE Plugins**: Native TLDL entry creation and management
- **Calendar Integration**: Automatic entry scheduling and reminders
- **Communication Tools**: Slack/Teams integration for sharing insights
- **Project Management**: JIRA/Asana integration for requirement traceability
