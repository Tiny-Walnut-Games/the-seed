## Faculty Consultation Results

### Present Wisdom - The Advisor

> Monetization posture: Badge registry + anti‚Äëtheft primitives are central; enforce perk immutability and lineage checks in CI for trust. Learning loop: TLDL-powered rituals are strong; codify 'XP-for-docs' telemetry and surface contributor progress in README badges. Operational risk: Repo sprawl across genres risks docs drift; establish genre pack templates and a single source of truth. Pipeline hygiene: Lock down Action permissions, pin actions, and require CODEOWNERS reviews for monetization and badge areas. Community runway: Shape a 'Schoolhouse' track: quickstart quests, example PRs, and Faculty badges to accelerate first‚Äëtime contributors.

#### Prioritized Action Items

**1. Perk immutability guardrails in CI** (High impact, Medium effort)
- **Description**: Add schema checks + signed manifest verification for perks; block changes outside approved migration scripts.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: security
- **Priority Score**: 95

**2. Genre pack templates** (High impact, Medium effort)
- **Description**: Provide starter docs, quests, and XP tables per genre; DRY via a common template folder and symlink or generator.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: documentation
- **Priority Score**: 90

**3. Badge registry integrity checks** (High impact, Low effort)
- **Description**: Verify badge IDs, signatures, and issuance logs on PR; publish a public verify endpoint/readme snippet.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: security
- **Priority Score**: 88

**4. Contributor 'First Quest' path** (Medium impact, Low effort)
- **Description**: A single labeled issue + sample PR that walks through docs XP, commit rituals, and Faculty stamps.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: community
- **Priority Score**: 75

**5. Actions hardening** (High impact, Low effort)
- **Description**: `permissions: contents: read`, `pull-requests: write` only where needed; pin SHA for all actions; restrict reusable workflows by `workflow_call`.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: security
- **Priority Score**: 85

**6. XP telemetry surface** (Medium impact, Medium effort)
- **Description**: Emit XP and completeness scores to a JSON artifact; render shields in README and per‚ÄëPR comments.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: gamification
