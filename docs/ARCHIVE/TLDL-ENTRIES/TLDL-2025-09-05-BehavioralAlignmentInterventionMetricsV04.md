## Objective

Transform Alice's ad hoc interventions into a structured, metrics-driven behavioral alignment system that learns from user interactions and adapts intervention strategies over time. Implement comprehensive intervention classification, acceptance tracking, style adaptation, reflective loops, and policy injection capabilities.

## Discovery

Current intervention system lacks:
- Structured classification of intervention types (soft suggestion, rewrite, block)
- Metrics for tracking user acceptance and over-intervention patterns  
- Style adaptation model that learns user preferences over time
- Reflective feedback loops that explain intervention reasoning
- Policy injection layer for configurable intervention behavior

## Actions Taken

1. **Core Intervention Metrics Engine** (`engine/intervention_metrics.py`)
   - Created `InterventionType` enum with 5 distinct classification types
   - Implemented `AcceptanceStatus` tracking for complete response lifecycle
   - Built `InterventionRecord` dataclass with full intervention lifecycle tracking
   - Designed `StyleProfile` system for user adaptation patterns with 3-phase learning

2. **Policy Injection System** (`data/intervention_policies.json`)
   - Configurable intervention thresholds per intervention type
   - Style adaptation parameters (learning phases, tolerance adjustments)
   - Reflective loop templates with dynamic content injection
   - Behavioral flags and governance integration weights

3. **Enhanced Governance Integration** (`engine/behavioral_governance.py`)
   - Extended existing `governance.py` with intervention-aware cycle scoring
   - Implemented response filtering with automatic intervention triggers
   - Created behavioral alignment assessment algorithms
   - Built comprehensive insights and recommendation engine

4. **Comprehensive Testing & Validation** (`tests/test_behavioral_alignment.py`)
   - End-to-end demo showcasing all milestone features
   - Real intervention scenarios with acceptance tracking
   - Policy injection testing and style adaptation validation
   - Integration testing with existing telemetry and governance systems

## üîÑ Workflow Integration Points

### **Enhanced Governance Scoring**
```python
def enhanced_score_cycle(cycle_report, intervention_context=None):

```

### **Intelligent Response Filtering**
```python
def enhanced_filter_response(response, user_id="default", context=None):
    filtered_response = governance.filter_response(response)
