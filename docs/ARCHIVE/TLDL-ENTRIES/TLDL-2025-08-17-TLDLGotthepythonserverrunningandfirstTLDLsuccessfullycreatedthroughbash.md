## Discoveries

### [Initial Difficulty Curve Was Higher Than Expected]
- **Key Finding**: I honestly was not able to get the Python server running myself, but I was able to get it running with help from @copilot.
- **Impact**: Being able to run the Python server is crucial for the Chronicle Keeper to function properly and generate TLDL entries.
- **Evidence**: The Python server is now running successfully, and the first TLDL entry has been created.
- **Pattern Recognition**: This discovery highlights the importance of collaboration and leveraging AI assistance in development tasks.
- **Root Cause**: Initial challenges in setting up the Python environment and server configuration.
- **Resolution**: Worked with @copilot to troubleshoot and resolve the issues, leading to a successful setup. More info can be found in the [Chronicle Keeper Log Location Guide](./TLDL-2025-08-17-ChronicleKeeperLogLocationGuide.md).

### [Discovery #2: First TLDL Entry Created]
- **Key Finding**: The first TLDL entry was successfully created using the Python TLDL wizard.
- **Impact**: This marks a significant milestone in the Chronicle Keeper's functionality, demonstrating its ability to generate and commit entries reliably.
- **Evidence**: The entry file exists under docs/ with the expected naming format and content.
- **Pattern Recognition**: The Chronicle Keeper workflow functions when prerequisites (Python, dependencies, correct shell invocations) are satisfied.
- **Root Cause**: Successful execution of the local MCP server and the TLDL wizard.
- **Resolution**: Entry was created and is visible in the nested Git repo for the plugin.

### [Discovery #3: Workflow Automation]
- **Key Finding**: Local HTTP tooling and a CLI wizard reduce friction for creating entries compared to manual copying of templates.
- **Impact**: Speeds up documentation capture and lowers the barrier for non-bash users on Windows.
- **Evidence**: Interactive wizard produced a complete entry; server health endpoint validated service status.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Developer experience improves with guided flows and Windows-friendly launchers.
- **Root Cause**: Prior reliance on bash-only flows and manual file edits.
- **Resolution**: Introduced guided flows (CLI wizard; Unity Editor window available for in-Editor creation).

## Actions Taken

1. Verified Python installation and installed project requirements (fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, PyYAML); upgraded pip.
2. Started the local MCP server via `py -3 -m scripts.mcp_server` and validated with GET /health (200 OK).
3. Ran the interactive TLDL CLI wizard (`python scripts/tldl_wizard.py`) and created the first entry.
4. Observed UTC deprecation warnings from Python 3.13 in the wizard; noted need for timezone-aware datetimes.
5. Confirmed the new TLDL file exists under `Assets/Plugins/living-dev-agent/docs/` and appears in the plugin‚Äôs nested Git repo.
6. Documented Windows-friendly steps and the benefit of IDE Git root mapping for the nested repo.

## Technical Details

### Code Changes
- Added a TLDL CLI wizard to streamline entry creation on Windows.
- Added a Unity Editor window (Tools ‚Üí Living Dev Agent ‚Üí TLDL Wizard) to create entries from inside Unity.
- Introduced Windows-friendly launchers for the local server as needed.

### Configuration Updates
- No repo-wide config changes required for this operation.
- Optional: map `Assets/Plugins/living-dev-agent` as a separate Git root in Rider/VS for visibility of new docs.

### Terminal Proof of Work
```
(.venv) PS D:\Tiny Walnut Games\TWG-LivingDevAgent> cd "D:\Tiny Walnut Games\TWG-LivingDevAgent\Assets\Plugins\living-dev-agent"

## Dependencies
- Added: fastapi 0.116.x, uvicorn 0.35.x, pydantic 2.11.x (via requirements); PyYAML already present.
- Updated: pip 25.2 (user scope on Windows).

## Lessons Learned
- Windows shells may reject .cmd invocation; prefer `py -3 -m ...` or use `.bat` launchers.
- Nested Git roots require IDE mapping to see new docs in commit windows.
- Guided tools (wizard/UI) beat manual template edits for speed and consistency.
- Clear startup logs and health checks reduce confusion when a server appears to ‚Äúdo nothing.‚Äù

## Next Steps
- Switch the CLI wizard to timezone-aware datetimes to remove deprecation warnings.
- Add Run Configs in Rider/VS to one-click start the server and open the wizard.
- Encourage Unity users to adopt the in-Editor TLDL Wizard (Tools menu) for faster capture.
- Consider simple REST endpoints for pre-approved TLDL templates/forms.
- Tighten docs with a Windows/Rider quick-start and nested-repo note.
