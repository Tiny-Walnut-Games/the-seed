## Discoveries

### DTT Vault Architecture Requirements
- **Immutable Bricks**: Content-addressed storage using SHA-256 for deduplication
- **Layered Storage**: Hot (Layer-0), Warm (Layer-1), Cold (Layer-2+) with automatic promotion
- **Tetrino Slam Compaction**: Threshold-based automatic layer compaction algorithm
- **Quarantine Restores**: Safety-first restoration to dedicated branches
- **Fenced Operations**: All vault operations wrapped in integrity gates

### Content Addressing Strategy
- First 16 characters of SHA-256 hash as brick ID
- Whole repository state hashing including git metadata
- Reference counting for proper deduplication tracking
- Manifest files containing brick metadata and integrity information

### Integration Patterns
- Seamless integration with existing LDA CLI infrastructure
- Preservation of existing DevTimeTravel configuration patterns
- Git-aware operations with proper branch handling
- Configurable retention policies and compaction thresholds

## Actions Taken

1. **Core DTT Vault Infrastructure**
   - **What**: Created `.dtt/vault/` directory structure with 3-layer storage system
   - **Why**: Implement the architectural metaphor with fenced vault, bricks, and layers
   - **How**: Python implementation with configurable layer thresholds and retention policies
   - **Result**: Complete vault system supporting init, snapshot, restore, verify, compact, prune operations
   - **Files Changed**: `scripts/dtt` (new), `.dtt/config.yml` (new), directory structure created

2. **Content-Addressed Brick System**
   - **What**: Implemented immutable bricks with SHA-256 content addressing
   - **Why**: Ensure deduplication and integrity across all vault operations
   - **How**: Hash entire repository state, create compressed archives, track references
   - **Result**: Efficient storage with automatic deduplication and integrity verification
   - **Files Changed**: Brick creation and manifest logic in `scripts/dtt`

3. **Tetrino Slam Compaction Algorithm**
   - **What**: Automatic layer compaction based on configurable thresholds
   - **Why**: Maintain storage efficiency while preserving access to historical states
   - **How**: Combine multiple source bricks into single compacted archives in next layer
   - **Result**: Working compaction system that promotes bricks from hot to warm to cold layers
   - **Files Changed**: Compaction logic in `scripts/dtt`

4. **Quarantine Restore System**
   - **What**: Safety-first restoration to dedicated git branches
   - **Why**: Prevent accidental overwrites of working state during restoration
   - **How**: Create branches with `dtt/reconstruct/` prefix, require `--force` flag
   - **Result**: Safe restoration workflow that preserves development context
   - **Files Changed**: Restore logic in `scripts/dtt`

5. **LDA CLI Integration**
   - **What**: Integrated DTT vault as `lda dtt` subcommand with full argument parsing
   - **Why**: Provide unified interface consistent with existing LDA CLI patterns
   - **How**: Added DTT subparser with all vault operations accessible via `lda dtt`
   - **Result**: Seamless integration allowing `lda dtt snapshot`, `lda dtt restore`, etc.
   - **Files Changed**: `scripts/lda` (DTT integration), help text updates

6. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - **What**: Created test suite covering initialization, snapshots, verification
   - **Why**: Ensure vault integrity and proper operation of all core features
   - **How**: Subprocess-based testing with temporary directories for isolation
   - **Result**: Full test coverage with 3/3 tests passing
   - **Files Changed**: `tests/test_dtt_vault.py` (new)

7. **Documentation and Configuration**
   - **What**: Created comprehensive documentation and proper gitignore integration
   - **Why**: Enable proper usage and prevent vault contents from entering version control
   - **How**: Detailed markdown documentation with examples and architecture diagrams
   - **Result**: Complete user guide and proper repository hygiene
   - **Files Changed**: `docs/DTT-Vault-Documentation.md` (new), `.gitignore` (DTT vault exclusion)

## Technical Details

### Directory Structure Implementation
```
.dtt/
  vault/
    layer-0/{bricks,manifests}/  # Hot: Recent snapshots
    layer-1/{bricks,manifests}/  # Warm: Compacted from Layer-0
    layer-2/{bricks,manifests}/  # Cold: Deep archive
  index/
    catalog.json                 # Central brick registry
    refcounts.json              # Reference counting
  config.yml                     # Vault configuration
  logs/events.log               # Audit trail
```

### Content Addressing Algorithm
- Combines git commit hash with all tracked file contents
- SHA-256 hashing for cryptographic integrity
- First 16 characters used as brick identifier
- Reference counting enables safe garbage collection

### Compaction Strategy (Tetrino Slam)
- Layer-0 max: 500 bricks or 4GB triggers compaction to Layer-1
- Layer-1 max: 100 bricks or 16GB triggers compaction to Layer-2
- Combined archives preserve individual brick accessibility
- Atomic operations ensure vault consistency

### Safety Mechanisms
- All restores create quarantine branches (`dtt/reconstruct/{brick_id}`)
- Force flag required for actual restoration
- Integrity verification on all brick access
- Audit logging for all vault operations

### CLI Command Coverage
- `dtt init` - Initialize vault structure
- `dtt snapshot` - Create immutable repository snapshots
- `dtt restore` - Restore to quarantine branches
- `dtt verify` - Integrity verification
- `dtt compact` - Manual layer compaction
- `dtt prune` - Retention policy enforcement

### Dependencies and Integration
- Built on existing Python infrastructure (PyYAML, subprocess)
- Git-aware operations for proper repository handling
- Seamless LDA CLI integration maintaining command consistency
- Compatible with existing DevTimeTravel configuration patterns

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **Metaphor-Driven Architecture**: Implementing the vault/brick/layer metaphor created intuitive system design
- **Content Addressing**: SHA-256 deduplication provides both integrity and storage efficiency
- **Safety-First Design**: Quarantine restores prevent accidental data loss
- **Layered Compaction**: Tetrino Slam algorithm balances performance and storage efficiency
- **CLI Integration**: Reusing existing LDA patterns created consistent user experience

### What Could Be Improved
- **Restore Performance**: Large repository restoration could benefit from incremental extraction
- **Cross-Layer Search**: Finding specific snapshots across layers could be optimized
- **Network Storage**: Future cloud storage backends for enterprise deployment
- **Encryption**: At-rest encryption for sensitive repository content

### Knowledge Gaps Identified
- **Scale Testing**: Performance characteristics with large repositories (>1GB)
- **Concurrent Access**: Multi-user vault access patterns and locking strategies
- **Recovery Scenarios**: Vault corruption recovery and redundancy strategies
