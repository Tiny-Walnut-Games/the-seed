## Context

Implementing Milestone v0.3: Summarization Ladder & Memory Compression for the TWG-TLDA Cognitive Geo-Thermal Lore Engine. This milestone transforms flat, unstructured memory storage into a sophisticated hierarchical summarization system with conflict detection and intelligent retrieval capabilities.

### Problem Statement
- Current memory storage was flat and unstructured, limiting long-term coherence
- Retrieval was inefficient without semantic grounding
- No conflict detection for clashing statements
- Summarization was manual and not anchored to cognitive state
- Missing anchor-grounded recall context API

### Adventure Context
This represents a major evolution in the "Save the Butts" philosophy - building a memory compression system that preserves critical context while efficiently managing information growth. The implementation leverages the existing semantic anchor foundation to create a multi-layered memory architecture.

## Implementation

### Core Components Delivered

#### 1. SummarizationLadder (17.4KB)
- **Micro-summary worker**: Rolling N-window summaries of recent fragments
- **Macro distillation**: Pipeline processing after N micro-summaries accumulated  
- **Recovery distillation**: Anchor reinforcement during distillation process
- **Compression metrics**: Tracks compression ratios, processing efficiency, temporal coverage
- **Configurable parameters**: Window sizes, trigger counts, maximum summaries

#### 2. ConflictDetector (24.4KB) 
- **Semantic opposition detection**: Uses embeddings to find conflicting statements
- **Conflict types**: Semantic opposition, logical contradiction, factual inconsistency, temporal conflicts
- **Evidence collection**: Confidence scoring, opposition indicators, context overlap analysis
- **System health monitoring**: Tracks conflict distribution and provides recommendations
- **Lifecycle management**: Automatic cleanup of old statements and conflicts

#### 3. RetrievalAPI (32.1KB)
- **Multi-modal retrieval**: Semantic similarity, temporal sequence, anchor neighborhood, provenance chain
- **Composite queries**: Combines multiple retrieval modes with weighted relevance
- **Context assembly**: Intelligent combination of results with quality scoring
- **Performance optimization**: Query caching, temporal decay, conflict awareness
- **Comprehensive metrics**: Cache hit rates, quality distribution, success rates
