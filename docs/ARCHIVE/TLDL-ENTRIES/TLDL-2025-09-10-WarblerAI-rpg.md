- Summary: Complete project created from natural language request

## Objective
**User Request:** "Create a Zork-like randomly generated Text-based adventure game powered by Warbler. The game should launch with Unity's 2D features, have buttons for standard movement controls, but a standard chat system for interacting with everything else. Well... except for known items and interactables... for instance, if we examine a room, search a room, anything that would make a character examine things... buttons would pop up for picking or interacting with these items. I think a standard UI inventory might be helpful... a minimap showing areas we've  explored using acsii characters. I think you get the idea. The theme can be anything the player  requests and you can prompt them for ideas. It's a choose your own adventure. "
**AI Interpretation:** rpg (complex complexity)

## AI Analysis Results
### Game Type Detection
- **Type:** rpg
- **Complexity:** complex 
- **Timeline:** 8-12 weeks
- **Architecture:** MVC with ScriptableObject data

### Generated Systems
- **CharacterController.cs**: AI-generated charactercontroller implementation
- **InventorySystem.cs**: AI-generated inventorysystem implementation
- **CharacterStats.cs**: AI-generated characterstats implementation
- **DialogueSystem.cs**: AI-generated dialoguesystem implementation
- **QuestManager.cs**: AI-generated questmanager implementation
- **CombatSystem.cs**: AI-generated combatsystem implementation
- **SaveSystem.cs**: AI-generated savesystem implementation
- **LevelManager.cs**: AI-generated levelmanager implementation

### Key Mechanics Identified
- character progression
- inventory management
- dialogue trees
- quest tracking
- combat systems
- save/load functionality

### Folder Structure Created
- Scripts/Character/
- Scripts/Inventory/
- Scripts/Dialogue/
- Scripts/Quests/
- Scripts/Combat/
- Scripts/Managers/
- Scripts/UI/

## Development Roadmap
1. Character system and movement (Week 1-2)
2. Inventory and stats systems (Week 3-4)
3. Dialogue and quest systems (Week 5-6)
4. Combat mechanics (Week 7-8)
5. Save system and content (Week 9-10)
6. Polish and balancing (Week 11-12)

## Testing Strategy
- Save system testing
- Character progression validation
- Dialogue system testing
- Performance with large datasets

## Warbler Insights
RPGs require robust data management, flexible content systems, and deep player progression. Focus on modular design.

## Next Steps
1. **Review Generated Code**: Examine AI-generated scripts for customization opportunities
2. **Create Prefabs**: Build game objects based on generated system architecture
3. **Configure Scenes**: Set up game scenes according to requirements
4. **Test Integration**: Validate system interactions and performance
5. **Customize & Polish**: Adapt generated code to specific game vision
