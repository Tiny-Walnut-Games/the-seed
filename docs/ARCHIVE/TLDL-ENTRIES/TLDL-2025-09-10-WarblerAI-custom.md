## Objective
**User Request:** "Create a Zork-like randomly generated Text-based adventure game powered by Warbler. The game should launch with Unity's 2D features, have buttons for standard movement controls, but a standard chat system for interacting with everything else. Well... except for known items and interactables... for instance, if we examine a room, search a room, anything that would make a character examine things... buttons would pop up for picking or interacting with these items. I think a standard UI inventory might be helpful... a minimap showing areas we've  explored using acsii characters. I think you get the idea. The theme can be anything the player  requests and you can prompt them for ideas. It's a choose your own adventure. "
**AI Interpretation:** custom (moderate complexity)
**Recommended Architecture:** Component-based

## AI Analysis Results

## Warbler Insights
Fallback analysis - AI unavailable

## Next Steps
1. **Review Generated Code**: Check AI-generated scripts for project-specific customization needs
2. **Configure Unity Packages**: Install recommended packages through Package Manager
3. **Create Prefabs**: Set up game objects based on the generated system architecture
4. **Scene Setup**: Configure scenes according to the custom requirements
5. **Testing Phase**: Implement the AI-recommended testing strategy
6. **Iteration**: Use Warbler for continued development assistance
