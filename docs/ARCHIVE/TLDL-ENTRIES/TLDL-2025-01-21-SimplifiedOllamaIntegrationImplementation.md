## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Binary Management Strategy
```python
def _find_or_download_ollama(self) -> Optional[Path]:
    # 1. Check system-wide installation first
    # 2. Look for existing local binary
    # 3. Download from GitHub releases if needed
    # 4. Graceful failure with enhanced stub fallback
```

### Enhanced Stub Selection Logic
```python
def _generate_enhanced_stub_response(self, prompt, context, error):
    # 1. Keyword analysis for intent detection
    # 2. Context evaluation for specific guidance
    # 3. Template selection based on match
    # 4. Dynamic content generation with timestamps
    # 5. Professional formatting and error handling
```

### Error Resilience Design
- **Download Failures**: System continues with enhanced stubs
- **Binary Issues**: Graceful degradation with informative messages  
- **Network Problems**: Offline functionality maintained
- **Permission Errors**: Clear resolution guidance provided
