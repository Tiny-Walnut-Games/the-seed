# STAT7 Visualization Syntax Fix

## Problem
The STAT7 visualization had a JavaScript syntax error:
```
stat7threejs.html:1330 Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
```

## Root Cause
When I added the new enhancement methods (experiment controls, entity drill-down, advanced proofs), they were accidentally placed **outside** the STAT7Visualization class definition. This caused:
1. Methods to be floating in global scope
2. Duplicate method definitions
3. Invalid JavaScript syntax with misplaced closing brackets

## Solution
1. **Moved all methods inside the STAT7Visualization class** before the closing brace
2. **Removed duplicate method definitions** that were outside the class
3. **Fixed the closing bracket syntax** on line 1939

## Fixed Methods
All these methods are now properly inside the STAT7Visualization class:

### Experiment Control Methods
- `toggleExperiment(expId, button)`
- `startExperiment(expId)`
- `stopExperiment(expId)`
- `playAllExperiments()`
- `stopAllExperiments()`
- `clearAllExperiments()`
- `logExperiment(message)`

### Enhanced Entity Details Methods
- `closeEntityDetails()`
- `showEntityDetails(bitchainData, pointObject)`
- `extractNarrativeContent(bitchainData)`
- `findRelatedEntities(bitchainData)`
- `focusOnEntity(entityId)`

### Advanced Proof Methods
- `runSemanticFidelityProof()`
- `runResilienceTest()`

## Verification
The syntax error has been resolved. The STAT7Visualization class now has:
- ✅ Proper class structure with all methods inside
- ✅ No duplicate method definitions
- ✅ Correct JavaScript syntax
- ✅ All enhanced functionality intact

## Usage
1. Start the WebSocket server: `python stat7wsserve.py`
2. Open the visualization: `stat7threejs.html`
3. All enhanced features should now work without syntax errors

The visualization is now ready for use with all the enhanced features:
- Experiment selector (EXP01-EXP10)
- Entity drill-down with narrative content
- Advanced proofs (semantic fidelity, resilience testing)
- Fixed panel layout
- Real-time realm filtering
