# Phase 2: Warbler Integration, NPCs, and Cross-Realm Narrative

Complete guide to the Warbler narrative integration layer. Enables NPCs to be aware of players' multiverse journeys and generate dialogue based on cross-realm state.

## üìã Overview

Phase 2 adds **narrative intelligence** to the multiverse. Instead of NPCs being isolated in their game worlds, they now:

- **Remember player interactions** across all realms
- **React to player reputation** changes in real-time
- **Trigger quests** that span multiple game worlds
- **Generate context-aware dialogue** aware of player history
- **Participate in control-ticks** like game instances do

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Five Core Components

```
UniversalPlayerRouter (Extended)
    ‚îî‚îÄ> Narrative Events + NPC Memory Store

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Extended UniversalPlayerRouter

### What Changed

Added narrative tracking and NPC memory support to the existing player router:

```python
router = UniversalPlayerRouter()

# New tracking systems
router.narrative_events  # Major story milestones
router.npc_memory_store  # NPC memories about players
```

### New Methods

#### `emit_narrative_event()`

Emit a major story event that NPCs can reference.

```python
event = router.emit_narrative_event(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    event_type="achievement",
    title="Slayed the Dragon",
    description="Alice defeated the ancient dragon in sol_2",
    metadata={"boss": "ancient_dragon", "realm": "sol_2"}
)
```

Types: `"achievement"`, `"milestone"`, `"discovery"`, `"conflict"`, `"dialogue"`, `"quest_completed"`

#### `store_npc_memory()`

Store what an NPC remembers about a player.

```python
router.store_npc_memory(
    npc_id="npc_merchant_001",
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    memory_type="encounter",
    content="Alice bought the enchanted sword",
    metadata={"item": "enchanted_sword", "price": 500}
)
```

#### `get_npc_memory_about_player()`

Retrieve what an NPC knows about a player.

```python
memory = router.get_npc_memory_about_player(
    npc_id="npc_merchant_001",
    player_id="alice_uuid"
)
# Returns:
# {
#   "player_name": "Alice",
#   "reputation_standing": {"the_wanderers": "liked", ...},
#   "legendary_items": ["Excalibur"],
#   "personality_modifiers": {"the_wanderers": "friendly"},
#   "memories": [...]
# }
```

#### `get_warbler_dialogue_context()`

Enhanced Warbler context including NPC-specific memories.

```python
context = router.get_warbler_dialogue_context(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    npc_id="npc_guard_001"  # Optional
)
# Includes:
# - Player journey narrative
# - Player reputation standings
# - NPC memories of player
# - Recent narrative events
# - Suggested dialogue topics
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Warbler Multiverse Bridge

**Location**: `web/server/warbler_multiverse_bridge.py`

Converts player multiverse state into NPC personality and dialogue context.

### Core Concepts

#### NPC Registration

Register NPCs with Warbler awareness:

```python
bridge = WarblerMultiverseBridge(player_router)

bridge.register_npc(
    npc_id="npc_merchant_001",
    npc_name="Elara the Merchant",
    realm_id="sol_1",
    personality_template="merchant",
    faction_allegiance="the_wanderers"
)
```

#### Dialogue Context Generation

Bridge generates context for Warbler dialogue:

```python
context = bridge.get_dialogue_context(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    npc_id="npc_merchant_001",
    conversation_history=[]
)
# Returns DialogueContext with:
# - player_journey: "Alice is a legendary wanderer..."
# - player_reputation: {"the_wanderers": "liked", ...}
# - npc_personality: personality modified by player standing
# - suggested_topics: dialogue ideas
```

#### Personality Modifiers

NPC behavior adapts based on player reputation with NPC's faction:

```
Player Standing ‚Üí NPC Behavior
"revered"      ‚Üí Reverent (bows, defers)
"liked"        ‚Üí Friendly (warm, welcoming)
"neutral"      ‚Üí Neutral (professional)
"disliked"     ‚Üí Suspicious (wary, cautious)
"despised"     ‚Üí Hostile (sneering, aggressive)
```

#### Player Arrival Broadcast

When player enters realm, notify all NPCs:

```python
notified_npcs = bridge.broadcast_player_arrival(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    realm_id="sol_2",
    arrival_type="portal"  # or "wounded", "victorious", etc.
)
# NPCs store this as a memory: "Alice arrived via portal"
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Warbler Query Service

**Location**: `web/server/warbler_query_service.py`

Independent service for querying NPCs across realms.

### Usage

#### Query NPC for Response

```python
query_service = WarblerQueryService(player_router, warbler_bridge)

response = query_service.query_npc(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    npc_id="npc_guard_001",
    user_input="Do you know of the legendary sword?",
    realm_id="sol_1"
)
# Returns:
# {
#   "status": "complete",
#   "npc_response": "Aye, I've heard tales of the legendary sword...",
#   "follow_ups": ["Tell me more.", "Where can I find it?"],
#   "response_time_ms": 12.5
# }
```

#### Conversation Sessions

Manage multi-turn conversations:

```python
# Start conversation
session = query_service.start_conversation(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    npc_id="npc_merchant_001",
    realm_id="sol_1"
)

# Query within session
response = query_service.query_npc(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    npc_id="npc_merchant_001",
    user_input="What's your best offer?",
    realm_id="sol_1",
    session_id=session.session_id
)

# End conversation
summary = query_service.end_conversation(session.session_id)
# Emits narrative event: "Parted ways with merchant"
```

#### Response Caching

Responses are cached for performance:

```python
stats = query_service.get_service_stats()
# {
#   "total_queries": 150,
#   "cache_hits": 45,
#   "cache_hit_rate": 30.0,
#   "avg_response_time_ms": 8.5
# }
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ City Simulation Integration

**Location**: `web/server/city_simulation_integration.py`

NPCs become first-class multiverse citizens participating in control-ticks.

### Setup

#### Register City Simulation

```python
integration = CitySimulationIntegration(
    orchestrator,      # MultiGameTickEngine
    player_router,     # UniversalPlayerRouter
    warbler_bridge,    # WarblerMultiverseBridge
    warbler_query_service
)

# Register cities in each realm
npc_ids = integration.register_city_simulation(
    realm_id="sol_1",
    city_simulation=city_sim,
    num_npcs=50  # Create 50 NPCs in this city
)
```

### NPC Participation in Control-Ticks

NPCs synchronize during orchestrator control-ticks:

```python
# During orchestrator execution
metrics = integration.synchronize_npc_tick(
    control_tick_id=1,
    elapsed_ms=100.0
)
# Returns:
# {
#   "npcs_synchronized": 150,
#   "npc_events_processed": 5,
#   "npc_state_changes": 3
# }
```

### Event Handling

#### Player Arrival

Notify NPCs when player enters realm:

```python
integration.on_player_transition(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    source_realm="sol_1",
    target_realm="sol_2",
    event_data={"reason": "portal"}
)
# NPCs in sol_2 become aware of Alice's arrival
# NPC memory: "Alice arrived via portal"
```

#### Cross-Realm Events

Propagate cross-game events to NPCs:

```python
integration.on_cross_game_event({
    "event_id": "world_01",
    "event_type": "world_event",
    "description": "Ancient ruins discovered",
    "affected_realms": ["sol_1", "sol_2", "sol_3"]
})
# All NPCs in affected realms react to the event
```

#### Reputation Changes

NPCs allied with faction react to player reputation changes:

```python
integration.on_reputation_change(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    faction="the_wanderers",
    new_standing="revered"
)
# Wanderer NPCs become deferential toward Alice
# Realm Keeper NPCs become more wary
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Realm Quest System

**Location**: `web/server/cross_realm_quests.py`

Quests spanning multiple game worlds with shared progression.

### Creating Quests

#### Simple Quest

```python
quest_system = CrossRealmQuestSystem(player_router, city_integration)

quest = quest_system.create_quest(
    quest_id="find_shards",
    title="The Shattered Crown",
    description="Find pieces of the ancient crown",
    giver_npc="npc_elder_001",
    starting_realm="sol_1",
    quest_type="multi_realm_chain",
    difficulty="hard",
    reward_xp=5000
)
```

#### Adding Objectives Across Realms

```python
# Objective in sol_1
quest_system.add_objective(quest.quest_id, {
    "objective_id": "fetch_shard_1",
    "description": "Find crown shard in sol_1",
    "realm": "sol_1",
    "objective_type": "fetch_item",
    "target": "crown_shard_1",
    "reward_xp": 1500
})

# Objective in sol_2
quest_system.add_objective(quest.quest_id, {
    "objective_id": "fetch_shard_2",
    "description": "Find crown shard in sol_2",
    "realm": "sol_2",
    "objective_type": "fetch_item",
    "target": "crown_shard_2",
    "reward_xp": 1500
})

# Objective in sol_3
quest_system.add_objective(quest.quest_id, {
    "objective_id": "deliver_crown",
    "description": "Deliver crown to Archive in sol_3",
    "realm": "sol_3",
    "objective_type": "talk_to_npc",
    "target": "npc_archivist_001",
    "reward_xp": 2000
})
```

### Player Quest Progression

#### Accept Quest

```python
success, msg = quest_system.accept_quest(player_id, quest_id)
# Emits narrative event: "Accepted quest: The Shattered Crown"
```

#### Progress Objective

```python
success, msg, context = quest_system.progress_objective(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    quest_id="find_shards",
    objective_id="fetch_shard_1",
    progress=1
)
# Returns:
# {
#   "progress": 1,
#   "required": 1,
#   "completed": true,
#   "objective_completed": true
# }
```

#### Complete Quest

```python
success, msg, rewards = quest_system.complete_quest(
    player_id="alice_uuid",
    quest_id="find_shards"
)
# Returns:
# {
#   "xp": 5000,
#   "items": ["crown_legendary"],
#   "reputation": {"realm_keepers": 500, "the_wanderers": 300}
# }
```

### Quest Discovery

Quests available in a realm:

```python
available = quest_system.get_available_quests_in_realm("sol_1")
# [{
#   "quest_id": "find_shards",
#   "title": "The Shattered Crown",
#   "difficulty": "hard",
#   "reward_xp": 5000
# }]
```

## üîÑ Integration Example: Full Flow

```python
# 1. Initialize systems
orchestrator = MultiGameTickEngine()
player_router = UniversalPlayerRouter()
warbler_bridge = WarblerMultiverseBridge(player_router)
warbler_query = WarblerQueryService(player_router, warbler_bridge)
city_integration = CitySimulationIntegration(
    orchestrator, player_router, warbler_bridge, warbler_query
)
quest_system = CrossRealmQuestSystem(player_router, city_integration)

# 2. Create player
alice = player_router.create_player("Alice", "human", "sol_1")

# 3. Register cities in realms
for realm in ["sol_1", "sol_2", "sol_3"]:
    npc_ids = city_integration.register_city_simulation(realm, None, 50)

# 4. Register specific NPCs with Warbler
bridge.register_npc("npc_guard_001", "Captain Guard", "sol_1", "guard", "realm_keepers")

# 5. Alice accepts multi-realm quest
available = quest_system.get_available_quests_in_realm("sol_1")
quest_system.accept_quest(alice.player_id, available[0]["quest_id"])

# 6. Alice travels to sol_2
player_router.transition_player(alice.player_id, "sol_1", "sol_2", "Portal")
city_integration.on_player_transition(alice.player_id, "sol_1", "sol_2", {})

# 7. Alice gains reputation
player_router.modify_reputation(
    alice.player_id,
    ReputationFaction.REALM_KEEPERS,
    600  # Now "revered"
)
city_integration.on_reputation_change(alice.player_id, "realm_keepers", "revered")

# 8. Alice talks to NPC
session = warbler_query.start_conversation(
    alice.player_id,
    "npc_guard_001",
    "sol_1"
)
response = warbler_query.query_npc(
    alice.player_id,
    "npc_guard_001",
    "What do you know of me?",
    "sol_1",
    session.session_id
)
# NPC responds with reverence because Alice is "revered" by realm_keepers

# 9. Execute control-tick (NPCs sync with game worlds)
npc_metrics = city_integration.synchronize_npc_tick(1, 100.0)
```
