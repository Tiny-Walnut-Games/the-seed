# ✅ Delivery Checklist

## 🎯 Core Issue Resolution

- [x] **Issue**: Player count input selection (1000) didn't affect which tests ran
- [x] **Root Cause**: Input was defined but never referenced in jobs
- [x] **Solution**: Implemented matrix strategy that binds input to test selection
- [x] **Verification**: Tested that selecting 1000 now triggers `test_concurrent_1000_clients()`

```

### **After**
```
✅ Select 1000 players → runs test_concurrent_1000_clients()
✅ Can test 6 player counts (100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000)
✅ Can select different stress patterns
✅ Automatic soft-cap detection
✅ 3 stress patterns (standard, flood, spikes)
✅ 10 configurations in one run
✅ Comprehensive metrics
✅ GitHub issue analysis
```
