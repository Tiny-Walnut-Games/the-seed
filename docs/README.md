# 🌱 The Seed - Open Source Multiverse Simulation

**Building the backbone for an open-source virtual multiverse using STAT7 (7-dimensional addressing).**

Think *Ready Player One's Oasis*, but **decentralized**, **MIT-licensed**, and **open for any developer** to join.

---

## 🎯 **Project Vision**

The Seed provides the **addressing backbone** for interconnected virtual worlds where:

- 🌍 **Developers register games** as virtual worlds
- 📍 **STAT7 addressing** enables cross-world coordination
- ⚡ **Narrative latency optimization** reduces communication overhead
- 🎮 **Players interact seamlessly** across different game universes
- 🔗 **Stories and NPCs coordinate** across boundaries with minimal semantic delay

---

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

This project consists of **three interconnected systems** with clear boundaries:

### **🎮 TLDA (Unity) System**
*Game Engine Layer - Unity-specific implementation*
- Companion battle systems
- Warbler NPC integration
- Steam platform integration
- Unity editor tools
- Game mechanics and asset management

### **🌐 Seed (Python) System**
*Backend Engine - STAT7 addressing and AI*
- STAT7 7-dimensional addressing experiments
- Living Dev Agent AI assistant
- WebSocket server infrastructure
- Data processing and analysis
- Development tooling

### **🔗 Bridge Components**
*Communication Layer - System Integration*
- WebSocket communication protocols
- 7D→3D projection for visualization
- Unity↔Python data bridges
- JSON schema contracts
- Real-time event streaming

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **For STAT7 Visualization:**
```bash
cd E:/Tiny_Walnut_Games/the-seed
python web/launchers/run_stat7_visualization.py
```

### **For Unity Development:**
1. Open project in Unity Hub
2. Navigate to `Assets/Plugins/TWG/TLDA/`
3. Run Unity Test Runner for TLDA components

### **For Python Development:**
```bash
cd E:/Tiny_Walnut_Games/the-seed
python Packages/com.twg.the-seed/seed/engine/run_exp_phase1.py --quick
```

## 📚 **Documentation Structure**

This documentation is organized by system boundaries:

- **[TLDA/](TLDA/)** - Unity game engine documentation
- **[SEED/](SEED/)** - Python backend documentation
- **[BRIDGES/](BRIDGES/)** - Communication layer documentation
- **[DEVELOPMENT/](DEVELOPMENT/)** - Development guidelines
- **[API/](API/)** - API references

---

## 🎮 **STAT7 Addressing System**

STAT7 provides **7-dimensional addressing** for virtual entities:

1. **Realm** - Virtual world/universe identifier
2. **Lineage** - Entity hierarchy and inheritance
3. **Adjacency** - Connection relationships
4. **Horizon** - Temporal context and timeline
5. **Resonance** - Semantic similarity mapping
6. **Velocity** - Rate of change and dynamics
7. **Density** - Information concentration

This enables **narrative latency optimization** - stories and characters can reference each other across virtual worlds with minimal semantic overhead.
