## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 5 Major Implementations

1. **AddMessage()** - Chat messages now display
   - Was: Stub with TODO comments
   - Now: Creates and displays messages
   - Impact: Critical for chat functionality

2. **SaveTldlEntry()** - TLDL entries persist to disk
   - Was: Just a 100ms delay
   - Now: Saves to Application.persistentDataPath with error handling
   - Impact: Data no longer lost

3. **OnDestroy()** - Memory leak prevention (NEW)
   - Was: Missing entirely
   - Now: Cleans up all event subscriptions
   - Impact: Prevents memory leaks

4. **WarblerChatBridge** - Enhanced response system
   - Was: Hardcoded responses, no error handling
   - Now: 6 response categories, error handling, varied responses
   - Impact: More robust and realistic

5. **Code Cleanup** - Removed empty namespace and emojis
   - Was: Empty namespace and encoding issues
   - Now: Clean, compilable code
   - Impact: Removes compilation confusion
