## Template Instructions

### Usage Workflow

1. **Copy this template** when capturing a new idea
2. **Name the file** using pattern: `IDEA-YYYY-MM-DD-DescriptiveTitle.md`
3. **Fill all sections** before creating IDEA-tagged TLDL entry
4. **Link or embed** completed charter in TLDL entry
5. **Update status** as idea progresses through lifecycle

### Integration with TLDL

**Required**: All IDEA-tagged TLDL entries must reference a completed idea charter.

**TLDL Entry Pattern**:
```markdown
# 💡 TLDL: IDEA - [Idea Title]

**Charter Reference**: [Link to idea charter file]
**Charter Status**: [Current charter status]

[TLDL content following standard template...]
```

### Idea Lifecycle States
