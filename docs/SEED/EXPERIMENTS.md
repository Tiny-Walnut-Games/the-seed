# STAT7 Validation Experiments: Phase 1 Test Suite

Status: Production Implementation  
Phase: Phase 1 Doctrine (Locked)

Goal: Prove that STAT7 addressing and retrieval works at scale

---

## Experiment Suite Overview

10 interconnected experiments testing core STAT7 properties:
- Uniqueness and collision-free addressing
- Retrieval efficiency at scale
- Necessity of all 7 dimensions
- Fractal scaling properties
- Compression/expansion determinism
- Entanglement detection
- Mathematical validation

Success Criteria: All experiments pass with greater than 95% success rate at 1000+ data point scale.

## EXP-01: Address Uniqueness Test

Hypothesis: Every bit-chain in STAT7 coordinate space gets a unique address with zero collisions.

Method:
1. Generate synthetic data: 1000 random bit-chains with random STAT7 coordinates
2. Compute address hashes: Use SHA256(realm + lineage + adjacency + horizon + luminosity + polarity + dimensionality)
3. Check for collisions: Count unique hashes vs. total bit-chains
4. Statistical check: Run 10 iterations with different random seeds

Expected Result:
- 100% unique addresses across all 10 iterations
- No hash collisions
- Address computation is deterministic

Status: Complete - Zero collisions confirmed

---

## EXP-02: Retrieval Efficiency Test

Hypothesis: Retrieving a bit-chain by STAT7 address is fast (less than 1ms) even at large scales.

Method:
1. Build index: Create 10,000 bit-chains with indexed STAT7 coordinates
2. Random retrieval: Query random addresses 1000 times
3. Measure latency: Track mean, median, p95, p99 retrieval times
4. Benchmark: Compare against linear search baseline

Scale targets:
- 1K bit-chains: less than 0.1ms per query
- 10K bit-chains: less than 0.5ms per query
- 100K bit-chains: less than 2ms per query

Expected Result:
- Retrieval times scale logarithmically or better
- No linear degradation as dataset grows
- Index-based retrieval beats linear search by 10x+

Status: Complete - Meets all targets

---

## EXP-03: Dimension Necessity Test

Hypothesis: All 7 dimensions are necessary for unique addressing. Removing any dimension causes collisions.

Method:
1. Test removing each dimension one at a time
2. For each reduced-dimension variant, run uniqueness test
3. Measure collision rate

Expected Result:
- 6-dimension variants: High collision rates (proving dimension necessity)
- Removing any single dimension causes measurable collision increase
- 7-dimension version remains collision-free

Status: Complete - All dimensions proven necessary

---

## EXP-04: Fractal Scaling Test

Hypothesis: STAT7 addresses scale fractal-ally. Doubling data size increases address space proportionally.

Method:
1. Measure address distribution with 1K, 10K, 100K bit-chains
2. Calculate dimension utilization at each scale
3. Verify no pathological clustering

Expected Result:
- Linear scaling of address space with data size
- Uniform dimension distribution
- No "hot spots" or pathological clustering

Status: Executed (Oct 18)

## EXP-05: Compression/Expansion Determinism

Hypothesis: Bit-chains can be compressed and re-expanded deterministically.

Method:
1. Create bit-chain with known STAT7 coordinates
2. Compress to canonical form
3. Re-expand from canonical form
4. Verify final state matches original

Expected Result:
- Compression is lossless
- Re-expansion produces bit-for-bit identical state
- Canonical hash matches before/after

Status: Executed (Oct 18)

---

## EXP-06: Entanglement Detection

Hypothesis: STAT7 system can detect when bit-chains share semantic neighborhoods.

Method:
1. Create related bit-chains (intentionally similar)
2. Compute entanglement scores (adjacency proximity)
3. Verify detection accuracy

Expected Result:
- Related entities: High entanglement scores
- Unrelated entities: Low entanglement scores
- Scores are reproducible and deterministic

Status: Executed with math validation (Oct 19)
