## 📊 Progress Indicators Explained

### Ollama Progress Messages
- `📥 PHASE 1: Downloading Ollama Binary` - Binary download (may take 2-5 minutes)
- `🚀 PHASE 2: Starting Ollama Service` - Service initialization (30-60 seconds)
- `📥 PHASE 3: Ensuring Model Available` - AI model download (5-15 minutes for larger models)

- `🌐 PHASE 2: Browser Authentication` - OAuth flow (user dependent)
- `💾 PHASE 3: Storing Authentication Token` - Secure storage (5 seconds)

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Ollama Issues
- **"Failed to download Ollama"**: Check internet connection, or install manually from https://ollama.com
- **"Service not responding"**: Wait 30 seconds and try **🔄 Refresh All**
- **"Model download failed"**: Try a smaller model like `llama3.2:1b`

### GitHub Issues
- **"Browser didn't open"**: Copy the URL from Unity Console and open manually
- **"Authentication timed out"**: Try again, you have 3 minutes to complete
- **"Token storage failed"**: Check file permissions in your user directory

### General Issues
- **"Python not found"**: Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed and in PATH
- **"Script not found"**: Verify all files are present in the `scripts/` directory
- **"Permission denied"**: On Unix systems, ensure scripts are executable

## 🎯 Expected Timeframes

### First-Time Setup
- **Ollama binary download**: 2-5 minutes (50-100 MB depending on platform)
- **Ollama service start**: 30-60 seconds
- **Small model download**: 1-3 minutes (llama3.2:1b ≈ 1.3 GB)
- **GitHub authentication**: 1-2 minutes (user dependent)

### Subsequent Uses
- **Ollama start**: 10-30 seconds (binary already available)
- **GitHub validation**: 5-10 seconds (token already stored)

## 🔍 Diagnostic Information

The diagnostic tool provides comprehensive status information:

```json
{
  "ollama_available": true/false,
  "github_authenticated": true/false,
  "python_version": "3.12.3",
  "script_location": "/path/to/scripts",
  "recommendations": ["specific actions to take"]
}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

3. **Check Unity Console** for detailed logs if something goes wrong
4. **The diagnostic tool is your friend** - run it when things seem stuck

- **🟢 Connected** status for both Ollama and GitHub
- **Overall Status: 🟢 Both Providers Ready** in the connection details
- **Successful AI analysis** responses in the Warbler interface
