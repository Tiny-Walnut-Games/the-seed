## üé¨ Step 1: Create Your Practice Project (2 minutes)

Let's create a small project to practice with:

```bash
# Create your practice castle
mkdir my-first-tlda-adventure
cd my-first-tlda-adventure

# Initialize git (TLDA needs this)
git init
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Create a simple Python file to practice with
cat > hello_world.py << 'EOF'
def greet_user(name):
    """
    A friendly greeting function that demonstrates
    how TLDA captures code context.
    """
    if not name:
        return "Hello, mysterious stranger!"
    
    greeting = f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to TLDA!"
    print(greeting)
    return greeting

def main():
    # This is where we'll capture our first snapshot
    user_name = input("What's your name? ")
    message = greet_user(user_name)
    
    # Add some complexity for demonstration
    if "TLDA" in message:
        print("üéâ You're about to become a documentation wizard!")
    
    return message

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF

# Test that it works
python3 hello_world.py
# Enter your name when prompted
```

**What just happened?**
- üìÇ Created a project directory
- üå≥ Initialized Git (required for TLDA)
- üêç Created a simple Python script
- ‚úÖ Verified everything works

---

## ‚ö° Step 2: Setup TLDA Magic (3 minutes)

Now let's add TLDA to your project. We'll simulate the TLDA template setup:

```bash
# Create the required directories
mkdir -p .github/workflows
mkdir -p TLDL/entries
mkdir -p src/SymbolicLinter
mkdir -p src/CodeSnapshot
mkdir -p docs

# Create a simple TLDL template
cat > docs/tldl_template.yaml << 'EOF'
# TLDL Entry Template
title: "Entry Title"
metadata:
  entry_id: "TLDL-YYYY-MM-DD-Title"
  author: "Your Name"
  context: "Brief description"
  summary: "One sentence overview"

sections:
  objective: "What you were trying to accomplish"
  discovery: "What you learned"
  actions_taken: "Steps you took"
  key_insights: "Important lessons"
  next_steps: "What should happen next"
EOF

# Create a simple validation script
cat > validate_simple.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Simple validation script for demonstration"""
import os
import glob

def validate_tldl_files():
    tldl_files = glob.glob("TLDL/entries/*.md")
    print(f"üîç Found {len(tldl_files)} TLDL files")
    
    for file in tldl_files:
        with open(file, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            if '## Objective' in content:
                print(f"‚úÖ {os.path.basename(file)}: Has objective section")
            else:
                print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è {os.path.basename(file)}: Missing objective section")
    
    print("üéâ Validation complete!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    validate_tldl_files()
EOF

chmod +x validate_simple.py

# Create a simple snapshot script
cat > capture_snapshot.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Simple code snapshot script for demonstration"""
import sys

def capture_code_snapshot(filename, line_number, context_lines=5):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            lines = f.readlines()
        
        start_line = max(0, line_number - 1 - context_lines)
        end_line = min(len(lines), line_number + context_lines)
        
        print(f"üì∏ Code Snapshot: {filename}:{line_number}")
        print("=" * 50)
        
        for i in range(start_line, end_line):
            marker = ">>>" if i == line_number - 1 else "   "
            print(f"{marker} {i+1:3d}: {lines[i].rstrip()}")
        
        print("=" * 50)
        print(f"‚ú® Captured {end_line - start_line} lines with {context_lines} lines of context")
        
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"‚ùå File not found: {filename}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python3 capture_snapshot.py <filename> <line_number>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    line_number = int(sys.argv[2])
    capture_code_snapshot(filename, line_number)
EOF

chmod +x capture_snapshot.py

echo "üéâ TLDA setup complete! Your castle is ready."
```

**What just happened?**
- üìÅ Created TLDA directory structure
- üìú Set up TLDL template system
- ‚ö° Created simple validation tools
- üì∏ Built basic code snapshot capability

---

## üìú Step 3: Create Your First TLDL Entry (4 minutes)

Time to document your first development adventure:

```bash
# Create your first TLDL entry
cat > TLDL/entries/TLDL-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-MyFirstTLDAAdventure.md << 'EOF'
# üéâ My First TLDA Adventure

## Metadata
- **Entry ID:** TLDL-2024-01-15-MyFirstTLDAAdventure
- **Author:** Your Name
- **Context:** Learning how to use TLDA for development documentation
- **Summary:** Successfully set up TLDA and created my first documented development experience

## üéØ Objective
Learn how to use the Living Dev Agent (TLDA) system by:
- Setting up a practice project
- Creating my first TLDL entry
- Capturing code snapshots
- Understanding the validation process

## üîç Discovery
The TLDA system is actually quite intuitive! Key discoveries:
- **TLDL entries are just markdown files** with a specific structure
- **Code snapshots capture perfect context** around any line of code
- **Validation tools run quickly** and provide helpful feedback
- **Everything is designed to enhance, not interrupt** my coding flow

## ‚ö° Actions Taken
1. **Project Setup:**
   - Created `my-first-tlda-adventure` directory
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Created a simple Python script (`hello_world.py`)

2. **TLDA Installation:**
   - Set up required directory structure
   - Created TLDL template system
   - Built simple validation and snapshot tools

3. **First Documentation:**
   - Created this TLDL entry
   - Documented my learning process
   - Prepared to test code snapshot functionality

## üí° Key Insights

*This entry represents my first step into documented development adventures. Looking forward to building this knowledge over time!* ‚ú®
EOF

echo "üìú First TLDL entry created!"
echo "üìç Location: TLDL/entries/TLDL-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-MyFirstTLDAAdventure.md"
```

**What just happened?**
- üìù Created a properly formatted TLDL entry
- üß† Documented your learning process
- üìÖ Used standard naming convention
- üîó Included links to related resources

---

## üì∏ Step 4: Capture Your First Code Snapshot (3 minutes)

Let's capture some code context to understand how this works:

```bash
# Capture a snapshot of the greeting function
python3 capture_snapshot.py hello_world.py 5

# The output shows line 5 (the if statement) with context
```

You should see something like:
```
üì∏ Code Snapshot: hello_world.py:5
==================================================
    1: def greet_user(name):
    2:     """
    3:     A friendly greeting function that demonstrates
    4:     how TLDA captures code context.
    5:     """
>>> 6:     if not name:
    7:         return "Hello, mysterious stranger!"
    8:     
    9:     greeting = f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to TLDA!"
   10:     print(greeting)
   11:     return greeting
==================================================
‚ú® Captured 11 lines with 5 lines of context
```

Now let's capture a different section:
```bash
# Capture the main function logic
python3 capture_snapshot.py hello_world.py 18

# This shows the core logic with surrounding context
```

**Let's add the snapshot to our TLDL entry:**
```bash
# Append code snapshot to your TLDL entry
cat >> TLDL/entries/TLDL-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-MyFirstTLDAAdventure.md << 'EOF'

## üì∏ Code Snapshots

### Greeting Function Logic
```python
# Snapshot of hello_world.py:6 - Input validation
if not name:
    return "Hello, mysterious stranger!"

greeting = f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to TLDA!"
print(greeting)
return greeting
```

### Main Function Flow
```python
# Snapshot of hello_world.py:18 - Main program logic
user_name = input("What's your name? ")
message = greet_user(user_name)

# Add some complexity for demonstration
if "TLDA" in message:
    print("üéâ You're about to become a documentation wizard!")
```

**Context:** These snapshots demonstrate how TLDA captures just the right amount of code context for different purposes.
EOF
```

**What just happened?**
- üì∏ Captured code snapshots with perfect context
- üéØ Learned how to target specific lines
- üìù Added visual context to your TLDL entry
- üß† Understood the power of contextual documentation

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Validate Your Work (2 minutes)

Time to check that everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Run validation on your TLDL entry
python3 validate_simple.py

# You should see output like:
# üîç Found 1 TLDL files
# ‚úÖ TLDL-2024-01-15-MyFirstTLDAAdventure.md: Has objective section
# üéâ Validation complete!

# Check your project structure
echo "üìÅ Project structure:"
find . -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.py" | head -10

# Commit your work to git
git add .
git commit -m "üéâ First TLDA adventure complete

- Set up TLDA structure
- Created first TLDL entry documenting the learning process
- Captured code snapshots with context
- Validated documentation quality

This represents the foundation for documented development adventures!"

echo "üéâ Validation complete and work committed!"
```

**What just happened?**
- ‚úÖ Verified your TLDL entry follows the correct format
- üìÅ Confirmed all files are in the right places
- üíæ Committed your work to preserve this learning
- üéØ Validated that you understand the core concepts
