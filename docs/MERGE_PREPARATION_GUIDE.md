# 🚀 Merge Preparation Guide

**Step-by-step guide for safely merging seed-develop into main for pre-release.**

---

## 📋 **Pre-Merge Checklist**

### **✅ Completed Cleanup Tasks**
- [x] Created clear project-level README.md
- [x] Updated PR template to be system-agnostic
- [x] Created documentation index for navigation
- [x] Documented cleanup plan for future reference

### **🔍 Branch Status Verification**
Before proceeding, verify your current branch situation:

```bash
# Check current branch and status
git status
git branch -v

# Verify you're on seed-develop
git checkout seed-develop

# Ensure it's up to date with develop
git fetch origin
git log --oneline develop..seed-develop
```

---

## 🎯 **Merge Strategy**

### **Recommended Approach: Squash Merge**
Since you mentioned rebasing seed-develop on top of develop:

```bash
# 1. Ensure main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Switch to seed-develop and ensure it's clean
git checkout seed-develop
git pull origin seed-develop

# 3. Create a backup branch (safety first!)
git checkout -b seed-develop-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 4. Final rebase check (if needed)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop

# 5. Switch to main and merge
git checkout main
git merge --squash seed-develop

# 6. Review and commit
git status
git commit -m "feat: Pre-release candidate v0.1.0

- Updated project documentation and structure
- Generalized pull request template for multi-system support
- Added comprehensive documentation index
- Cleaned up repository organization
- Prepared for pre-release deployment"

# 7. Tag the release
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Pre-release candidate v0.1.0"

# 8. Push to main
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## 🛡️ **Safety Measures**

### **Before Merge:**
1. **Backup current state:**
   ```bash
   git checkout seed-develop
   git branch seed-develop-safety-backup
   ```

2. **Verify no uncommitted changes:**
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   # Should return empty
   ```

3. **Check for merge conflicts:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-commit --no-ff seed-develop
   # Review conflicts if any, then abort
   git merge --abort
   ```

### **After Merge:**
1. **Verify build still works**
2. **Run test suites**
3. **Check documentation links**
4. **Validate CI/CD pipelines**

---

## 🔄 **Post-Merge Actions**

### **Branch Cleanup:**
```bash
# Delete seed-develop after successful merge
git branch -d seed-develop
git push origin --delete seed-develop

# Keep backup branch for a while
# git branch -d seed-develop-backup-YYYYMMDD
```

### **Release Preparation:**
1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with release notes
2. **Create GitHub Release** from the tag
3. **Update version numbers** in project files
4. **Notify team** of release availability

---

## 📊 **Validation Steps**

### **Automated Checks:**
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation builds successfully
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities detected

### **Manual Verification:**
- [ ] Project builds from scratch
- [ ] Quick start instructions work
- [ ] Documentation links are valid
- [ ] All three systems (TLDA, Seed, Bridges) function

---

## 🚨 **Rollback Plan**

If issues arise after merge:

```bash
# Emergency rollback to previous state
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# Or use the backup tag if available
git reset --hard v0.0.1
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
