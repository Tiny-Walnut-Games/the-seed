# DevTimeTravel Decisions Index
# This file tracks architectural decisions and their evolution through the development timeline

decisions: []

# Schema for decision entries (future implementation):
# - id: unique identifier for the decision
# - title: brief description of the decision
# - date: when the decision was made (ISO format)
# - context: the situation that required a decision
# - alternatives: list of options that were considered
# - chosen: the selected option with rationale
# - consequences: observed outcomes and impacts
# - status: active | superseded | deprecated
# - tags: categorization labels for filtering
# - related_snapshots: references to DevTimeTravel snapshots
# - tldl_references: links to relevant TLDL entries

# Example structure (for reference):
# decisions:
#   - id: DEC-2025-001
#     title: "Implement Giant-in-the-Well compression system"
#     date: "2025-09-02T00:00:00Z"
#     context: "DevTimeTravel snapshots growing without compaction strategy"
#     alternatives:
#       - "Manual cleanup processes"
#       - "Simple time-based retention"
#       - "Layered compression with semantic preservation"
#     chosen: "Layered compression with semantic preservation"
#     rationale: "Balances storage efficiency with context preservation"
#     consequences: 
#       - "Reduced storage overhead"
#       - "Maintained historical context accessibility"
#       - "Enabled automated pressure management"
#     status: "active"
#     tags: ["storage", "compression", "devtimetravel"]
#     related_snapshots: []
#     tldl_references: ["TLDL-2025-09-02-DevTimeTravelCompression"]

# Future Integration:
# - Decision capture during snapshot creation
# - Automatic tagging based on file changes
# - Cross-references with TLDL entries
# - Decision impact analysis and tracking
# - Semantic similarity grouping for related decisions
