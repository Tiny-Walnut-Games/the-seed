# ????? **SACRED CODE CLASSIFICATION PROTOCOL**
## The Living Dev Agent's Extension Point Identification & Protection Manifesto

**BY THE POWER OF COORDINATE-AWARE DEVELOPMENT, LET IT BE KNOWN:**

## ?? **THE CUSTOMER FACING MANDATE**

## Mandate!!! This mandate over-rides the below taxonomy when informed of Customer Facing intention

### **Customer Facing (Sacred User Experience)**
**Comment Pattern**: `// !!! CUSTOMER FACING - User experience critical`
- Under the circumstance of a Custom Facing condition...
- All systems, methods, classes, enums, absolutely everything must be in its best version of full implementation as it can be.
- There are no exceptions to this rule. Everything must be perfect, which I consider to be >95% complete.
- We should only need to worry about the most minor of bugs or making QOL adjustments at the customer's request.

## ?? **SACRED TAXONOMY OVERVIEW**
The Sacred Code Classification System divides code into four distinct categories,
each with its own purpose and guidelines for modification.
This system is designed to balance the need for stability in core algorithms
with the flexibility required for project-specific enhancements.

Except in circumstances where Customer-Facing intent has been made, these will be the methods used.

```
