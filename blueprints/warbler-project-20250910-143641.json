    "user_request": "Create a Zork-like randomly generated Text-based adventure game powered by Warbler.\nThe game should launch with Unity's 2D features, have buttons for standard movement controls,\nbut a standard chat system for interacting with everything else.\nWell... except for known items and interactables... for instance, if we examine a room, search a room,\nanything that would make a character examine things... buttons would pop up for picking or interacting\nwith these items. I think a standard UI inventory might be helpful... a minimap showing areas we've \nexplored using acsii characters. I think you get the idea. The theme can be anything the player \nrequests and you can prompt them for ideas. It's a choose your own adventure.",
