### What Changed

**Phase 1 Doctrine hardened and locked.** Added 7 new core specification files to `seed/docs/lore/TheSeedConcept/`:

1. **PHASE_1_DOCTRINE.md** ‚Äî Executive summary of 5 key architectural decisions (mutability, hashing, LUCA bootstrap, STAT7 addressing, cross-faculty contracts)
2. **LUCA_ENTITY_SCHEMA.json** ‚Äî JSON Schema for all entities; defines identity_core, manifestations, entanglement_links, bit_chain_events with canonical hashing and chain integrity
3. **LUCA.json** ‚Äî Primordial entity instance with all hashes canonically computed (test fixture for validation experiments)
4. **STAT7_CANONICAL_SERIALIZATION.md** ‚Äî 500+ line rulebook: float normalization (8dp banker's rounding), deterministic JSON key ordering, ISO8601 timestamps, replay validation algorithm, cross-language implementation guidance (Python/JS/C#/Rust)
5. **STAT7_MUTABILITY_CONTRACT.json** ‚Äî Enforcement policy matrix (9 dimensions √ó 3 enforcement levels) + per-entity-type overrides (agent/artifact/concept stricter constraints)
6. **PHASE_1_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** ‚Äî Implementation cheat sheet with float normalization checklist, canonical serialization steps, mutability rules, common mistakes & fixes
7. **README.md** (updated) ‚Äî Complete orientation tying STAT7 to Faculty systems (Warbler, TLDL, SemanticAnchor, etc.) and 22-year design continuity

### Why

Copilot feedback integration (from #1 and #2) revealed six critical hardening points:

- **Mutability clarity:** Append-only adjacency with monotonicity guards; immutable realm/lineage; bounded horizon vocabularies per entity_type
- **First-class STAT7 addressing:** Store addresses explicitly (not derived on-the-fly) for fast spatial indexing
- **Deterministic hashing:** 8dp normalized floats, sorted JSON keys (ASCII), minified output, ISO8601 UTC milliseconds‚Äîensures cross-language consensus
- **Bit-chain audit trail:** Rolling chain integrity hash enables replay validation (detects retroactive edits)
- **Per-entity-type contracts:** Agents/artifacts/concepts have stricter boundaries atop global policy
- **Canonical serialization rules:** Language-specific implementation guide (Python/JS/C#/Rust all produce identical hashes)

**Result:** Phase 1 immutable and ready for validation experiments (EXP-01 through EXP-10).

### How to Test

1. Verify JSON schema validity: `LUCA_ENTITY_SCHEMA.json` is valid JSONSchema draft-7
2. Validate LUCA.json against schema (should pass cleanly)
3. Test canonical hash reproducibility: Serialize LUCA.json with the rules in STAT7_CANONICAL_SERIALIZATION.md; hash should match stored `canonical_hash`
4. Cross-language check: Implement serializer in any language from the guide; produce same LUCA.json hash

### Breaking Changes

None‚Äîthis is documentation/specification only. No code APIs affected.

## üéØ Related Issues

Closes #1  
Closes #2  
Prepares foundation for Phase 1 validation experiments (EXP-01, EXP-02, EXP-03)

## üß™ Testing Done

- [x] JSON schema structures validated for consistency
- [x] LUCA.json canonical hashes computed and verified
- [x] Serialization rules cross-checked against Copilot hardening feedback
- [x] STAT7 address format verified against DEEP_DIVE_MAP.md integration points
- [x] Mutability policies tested against entity lifecycle scenarios (genesis ‚Üí emergence ‚Üí peak ‚Üí decay ‚Üí crystallization)

## üì∏ Examples

**STAT7 Address Format (locked):**
```
stat7://{realm}/{lineage}/{adjacency_hash}/{horizon}?r={resonance}&v={velocity}&d={density}
```

**Mutability Rules Table:**

| Dimension | Policy | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Realm | ‚ùå Immutable | Cannot change "data" ‚Üí "narrative" |
| Lineage | ‚ùå Immutable | Cannot rewrite genealogy |
| Adjacency | ‚úÖ Append-only | Add neighbors; mark deprecated; never delete |
| Horizon | ‚ö†Ô∏è Bounded | Change lifecycle, only to allowed values |
| Luminosity | ‚úÖ Dynamic | Heat level 0-7, anytime |
| Resonance | ‚úÖ Dynamic | Charge, 8dp normalized, anytime |
| Velocity | ‚úÖ Dynamic | Rate of change, 8dp normalized, anytime |
| Density | ‚úÖ Dynamic | Compression, 8dp normalized, anytime |
| Dimensionality | ‚ÜîÔ∏è Fold/unfold | Change depth if reversible (fold_map_id) |

## üåü Additional Notes

**Phase 1 is now locked:**
- ‚úÖ Entity schema cannot shrink (can extend)
- ‚úÖ Serialization rules are canonical (no changes without consensus)
- ‚úÖ STAT7 addressing format fixed (9 dimensions, one coordinate per entity)
- ‚úÖ LUCA bootstrap defined and tested

**Next phase:** Begin Phase 2 Faculty integration (SemanticAnchor_CONTRACT, MoltenGlyph_CONTRACT, MistLine_CONTRACT, InterventionRecord_CONTRACT) after validation experiments confirm Phase 1 correctness.
