## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose One)

### Option 1: Run Quick Test (30 seconds)
```powershell
cd E:\Tiny_Walnut_Games\the-seed
python scripts/run_rag_stress_test.py --quick
```

**Output:** 3 critical tests
- ✅ Embedding generation at 100 items
- ✅ Anchor creation at 500 items  
- ✅ Retrieval performance at 500 items

### Option 2: Run Full Test (5-10 minutes)
```powershell
python scripts/run_rag_stress_test.py --full
```

**Output:** All 7 stress dimensions
- ✅ Embedding scale (100, 1K, 10K)
- ✅ Anchor deduplication
- ✅ Retrieval ranking quality
- ✅ Cache hit rates
- ✅ Concurrent query safety
- ✅ Memory/GC stability
- ✅ 5-minute soak test

### Option 3: Run Specific Tests with pytest
```powershell
# All tests
pytest tests/stress/test_rag_stress_suite.py -v -s

# Single test class
pytest tests/stress/test_rag_stress_suite.py::TestRAGStress -v

# Specific test
pytest tests/stress/test_rag_stress_suite.py::TestRAGStress::test_embedding_generation_scale -v

# Parametrized (all batch sizes)
pytest tests/stress/test_rag_stress_suite.py::TestRAGStress::test_embedding_generation_scale -v
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

| Dimension | Focus | Tests | Data |
|-----------|-------|-------|------|
| **Embedding** | Determinism & throughput | 2 tests | 100-10K items |
| **Indexing** | Anchor creation speed | 2 tests | 500-10K items |
| **Retrieval** | Query performance & ranking | 2 tests | 500-1K corpus |
| **Caching** | Hit rates & speedup | 1 test | 10 repeated queries |
| **Concurrency** | Thread safety | 1 test | 1/4/8 threads |
| **Memory** | GC pressure | 1 test | 5 × 128MB cycles |
| **Soak** | Sustained load | 1 test | 5 minutes @ ~200 QPS |

**Total:** 10 discrete tests + 6 parametrized tests = **16 test scenarios**

---

## 📈 Expected Results

When all tests pass, you'll see healthy metrics:

```
✅ Embedding Throughput:     > 500 items/sec
✅ Anchor Creation Speed:    > 500 anchors/sec
✅ Query Latency (p95):      < 25ms
✅ Cache Hit Rate:           > 80%

## 📚 Test Data: Warbler Packs

The suite uses **real content** from your conversation packs:

### Core Pack (8 templates)
Greetings, farewells, help requests, commerce interactions
```
"Greeting formal: Professional greeting for officials and merchants"
"Farewell friendly: Warm goodbye with well-wishes"
"Help general: General offer of assistance and local knowledge"
```

### Wisdom Scrolls (8 templates)
Development wisdom, debugging proverbs, documentation philosophy
```
"Refactoring is not admitting failure; it's evolution of understanding"
"The bug you can't reproduce is like the monster under the bed"
"Documentation is not what you write for others"
```

### Faction Politics (8 templates)
Political intrigue, diplomacy, betrayal, alliance
```
"Veiled warnings about faction displeasure and consequences"
"Offering to trade political secrets and intelligence"
"Diplomatic overtures for political cooperation"
```

**Result:** 24 templates → 100/1K/10K synthetic documents with variations

## 🔧 CI/CD Integration

### Add to GitHub Actions

```yaml
# .github/workflows/rag-stress-test.yml
name: RAG Stress Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  stress-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install pytest
      - name: Run RAG stress test
        run: python scripts/run_rag_stress_test.py --quick
```

### Add to Pre-commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Quick check on RAG changes
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "seed/engine/"; then
    echo "🧪 Running RAG stress test..."
    python scripts/run_rag_stress_test.py --quick || exit 1
fi
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Import failed: No module named 'seed.engine.embeddings'"
```powershell
# Ensure RAG components exist
pytest tests/test_exp08_rag_integration.py::TestRAGIntegration::test_01_embedding_generation -v
```

### Tests run very slowly
**This is normal on first run** - LocalEmbeddingProvider takes time to initialize. Subsequent runs use caching.

### Memory error during soak test
```powershell
# Reduce memory pressure in test config
# Edit: SOAK_DURATION_SECONDS = 60 * 2  # 2 min instead of 5
```

### Cache hit rate is low
**This is expected** - Soak test uses random queries. Run `test_cache_hit_rate_repeated_queries` for cache-specific tests.

## 🎬 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Validate (Today)
1. Run quick test: `python scripts/run_rag_stress_test.py --quick`
2. All tests pass? → Proceed to Phase 2 ✅
3. Tests fail? → Check troubleshooting above

### Phase 2: Document (Next)
1. Run full test: `python scripts/run_rag_stress_test.py --full`
2. Save results to `docs/VALIDATION-RESULTS.md`
3. Compare against benchmarks

### Phase 3: Integrate (Week)
1. Add to CI/CD pipeline
2. Track metrics over time
3. Set up regression alerts

### Phase 4: Scale (Later)
1. Increase soak duration (1 hour)
2. Test with 100K items
3. Add network latency simulation
4. Profile with external embedding service
