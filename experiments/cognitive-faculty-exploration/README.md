# üß†üìúüéì Cognitive Faculty Exploration - "Sending the Agent to School"

## Overview

This experimental framework explores the capabilities, limitations, and emergent behaviors of the TWG-TLDA living-dev-agent cognitive faculties by subjecting them to progressively challenging scenarios.

## Faculty Architecture Mapping

- **Components**: Intent processing (packages/warbler-core), Context parsing, Multi-modal understanding
- **Function**: Process external inputs and convert to internal representations
- **Test Focus**: Ambiguity handling, boundary detection, noise resistance

### 2. **Memory Faculty** (Storage & Retrieval)
- **Components**: Semantic anchors, Conflict detector, Retrieval API, Summarization ladder
- **Function**: Store, organize, and recall information with semantic grounding
- **Test Focus**: Conflict resolution, compression efficiency, retrieval accuracy

### 3. **Planning Faculty** (Strategic Analysis)
- **Components**: Oracle forecasting, Advisor analysis, Strategic scenario generation
- **Function**: Analyze current state and generate strategic guidance
- **Test Focus**: Uncertainty handling, resource optimization, scenario quality

### 4. **Reasoning Faculty** (Analysis & Decision)
- **Components**: Evidence evaluation, Similarity scoring, Conflict resolution
- **Function**: Analyze information and draw logical conclusions
- **Test Focus**: Edge case handling, confidence calibration, bias detection

### 5. **Actuation Faculty** (Output Generation)
- **Components**: TLDL generation, Report synthesis, Recommendation formatting

## Testing Philosophy

> "Every failure is a feature discovery. Every edge case is a design opportunity. Every stress test reveals the true character of the system." - Faculty Exploration Manifesto

### Progressive Stress Testing
1. **Baseline**: Normal operation under ideal conditions
2. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
3. **Stress Tests**: Resource constraints and challenging scenarios  
4. **Breaking Points**: Identify failure modes and limitations
5. **Emergent Behavior**: Document unexpected responses and adaptations

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- **Functional**: Does it work as intended?
- **Performance**: How efficiently does it operate?
- **Robustness**: How well does it handle stress?
- **Adaptability**: Can it learn and improve?
- **Emergent**: What unexpected behaviors arise?

## Experiment Categories

### A. Faculty Isolation Tests
Test each faculty independently to understand individual capabilities and limitations.

### B. Inter-Faculty Integration Tests  
Test communication and coordination between faculties under various conditions.

### C. System-Wide Stress Tests
Test the entire cognitive system under challenging real-world scenarios.

### D. Learning & Adaptation Tests
Test the system's ability to improve performance over time through experience.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- **Response Time**: Speed of faculty responses
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of outputs compared to expected results
- **Efficiency**: Resource utilization per operation
- **Consistency**: Repeatability of results under similar conditions

### Qualitative Measures  
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and internal consistency
- **Actionability**: Practical value of recommendations
- **Adaptability**: Ability to handle novel situations
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Unexpected but valuable behaviors

## Documentation Standards

All experiment results will be documented using TLDL format with:
- **Scenario Description**: What was tested and why
- **Expected Behavior**: Hypothesized outcomes
- **Actual Results**: What actually happened
- **Analysis**: Interpretation and implications
- **Recommendations**: Suggested improvements or further research

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Create experimental framework structure
2. ‚è≥ Implement faculty testing scenarios
3. ‚è≥ Run baseline measurements
4. ‚è≥ Execute progressive stress tests
5. ‚è≥ Analyze emergent behaviors
6. ‚è≥ Document findings and recommendations
