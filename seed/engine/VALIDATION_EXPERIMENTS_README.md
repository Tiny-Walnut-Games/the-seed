## Experiments Overview

### EXP-01: Address Uniqueness
**Hypothesis:** Every bit-chain gets a unique STAT7 address with zero collisions.

**What it tests:**
- Generate 1000 random bit-chains with all 7 STAT7 dimensions
- Compute SHA-256 hash (address) for each
- Verify no hash collisions
- Repeat 10 times with different random seeds

**Success criteria:** ✅ 100% unique addresses (0 collisions) across all iterations

**Example output:**
```
Iteration  1: ✅ PASS | Total: 1000 | Unique: 1000 | Collisions: 0
Iteration  2: ✅ PASS | Total: 1000 | Unique: 1000 | Collisions: 0
...
OVERALL RESULT: ✅ ALL PASS | Success rate: 10/10
```

### EXP-02: Retrieval Efficiency
**Hypothesis:** Looking up a bit-chain by STAT7 address is fast (< 1ms).

**What it tests:**
- Build indexed set of bit-chains at 3 scales: 1K, 10K, 100K
- Perform 1000 random lookups at each scale
- Measure latency: mean, median, p95, p99
- Verify sub-millisecond retrieval

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ 1K scale: mean < 0.1ms
- ✅ 10K scale: mean < 0.5ms
- ✅ 100K scale: mean < 2.0ms

**Example output:**
```
Testing scale: 1,000 bit-chains
  ✅ PASS | Mean: 0.0045ms | Median: 0.0032ms | P95: 0.0125ms | P99: 0.0284ms

Testing scale: 10,000 bit-chains
  ✅ PASS | Mean: 0.0051ms | Median: 0.0038ms | P95: 0.0156ms | P99: 0.0381ms

Testing scale: 100,000 bit-chains
  ✅ PASS | Mean: 0.0068ms | Median: 0.0051ms | P95: 0.0215ms | P99: 0.0512ms
```

### EXP-03: Dimension Necessity
**Hypothesis:** All 7 STAT7 dimensions are necessary to avoid collisions.

**What it tests:**
- Baseline: Compute hashes using all 7 dimensions (should be 0% collision)
- Ablation: Remove each dimension one at a time
- For each removal, recompute addresses and count collisions
- Verify removing any dimension causes > 0.1% collision rate

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ All 7 dimensions: 0.0% collisions
- ✅ Remove any 1 dimension: > 0.1% collisions (proves that dimension is necessary)

**Example output:**
```
Baseline: All 7 dimensions
  ✅ PASS | Collisions: 0 | Rate: 0.0000%

Ablation: Remove 'realm'
  ✅ NECESSARY | Collisions: 127 | Rate: 12.7000%

Ablation: Remove 'lineage'
  ✅ NECESSARY | Collisions: 89 | Rate: 8.9000%
...

OVERALL RESULT: All 7 dimensions are necessary (all show > 0.1% collisions when removed)
```

      "total_iterations": 10,
      "total_bitchains_tested": 10000,
      "total_collisions": 0,
      "overall_collision_rate": 0.0,

}
```

### What Each Result Means

#### ✅ PASS
- **EXP-01:** Zero collisions across all samples
- **EXP-02:** Mean retrieval latency below target for all scales
- **EXP-03:** All 7 dimensions show necessary (high collision when removed)

#### ❌ FAIL
- **EXP-01:** Hash collisions detected → indicates hash space exhaustion or addressing bug
- **EXP-02:** Retrieval latency exceeds target → indicates indexing problem or performance regression
- **EXP-03:** A dimension doesn't show necessity → indicates redundant or overlapping dimensions

## Implementation Details

### Canonical Serialization (Phase 1 Doctrine)
All address computation follows strict rules to ensure determinism:

1. **Float Normalization**
   - Round to 8 decimal places using banker's rounding
   - Strip trailing zeros (but keep at least one decimal)
   - Serialize as plain decimal (no scientific notation)
   - Examples: `0.5` → `0.5`, `1.123456789` → `1.12345679`

2. **JSON Key Ordering**
   - All object keys sorted alphabetically (ASCII, case-sensitive)
   - Applied recursively at all nesting levels
   - Ensures identical serialization across languages

3. **Timestamp Normalization**
   - Format: ISO8601 UTC with millisecond precision
   - Example: `2025-01-15T14:30:45.123Z`
   - All timestamps converted to UTC

4. **Address Computation**
   - Canonical JSON serialization (from above rules)
   - SHA-256 hash of the serialized bytes
   - Result: deterministic, collision-resistant address

### STAT7 Coordinates (7 Dimensions)
Each bit-chain is addressed by 7 immutable dimensions:

| Dimension     | Type     | Range                                                  | Role                                      |
|---------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **realm**     | string   | data, narrative, system, faculty, event, pattern, void | Domain classification                     |
| **lineage**   | integer  | 1+                                                     | Generation from LUCA (immutable)          |
| **adjacency** | string[] | append-only                                            | Relational neighbors (immutable order)    |
| **horizon**   | string   | genesis, emergence, peak, decay, crystallization       | Lifecycle stage (dynamic)                 |
| **resonance** | float    | -1.0 to 1.0                                            | Charge/alignment (normalized to 8 dp)     |
| **velocity**  | float    | unbounded                                              | Rate of change (normalized to 8 dp)       |
| **density**   | float    | 0.0 to 1.0                                             | Compression distance (normalized to 8 dp) |

## Troubleshooting

### ImportError: No module named 'stat7_experiments'
Make sure you're running from the correct directory:
```bash
cd E:/Tiny_Walnut_Games/the-seed
python scripts/run_exp_phase1.py
```

### EXP-01 Fails (Collisions Detected)
Indicates hash function collision. Options:
1. Increase hash output size (currently SHA-256)
2. Review canonical serialization rules
3. Check for floating-point precision issues

### EXP-02 Fails (High Latency)
Indicates indexing inefficiency. Options:
1. Check system load
2. Verify hash table implementation efficiency
3. Profile memory access patterns

### EXP-03 Fails (Dimension Not Necessary)
Indicates overlapping or redundant dimensions. Options:
1. Review dimension definitions
2. Check for strong correlation between dimensions
3. Consider merging overlapping dimensions

## Phase 2: Scaling Validation

### Quick Start (Phase 2)
```bash
# Quick mode: Test 1K, 10K, 100K scales
python scripts/run_exp_phase2.py

# Full mode: Also test 1M scale
python scripts/run_exp_phase2.py --full
```

### EXP-04: Fractal Scaling Test
**Status:** ✓ PASSED (2025-10-18)

**Hypothesis:** STAT7 maintains zero collisions and logarithmic retrieval complexity across 1000x scale progression.

**What it tests:**
- Generate bit-chains at 4 scale levels: 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M
- At each scale, run EXP-01 (uniqueness) + EXP-02 (retrieval)
- Measure collision rates and latency degradation
- Verify system remains stable at 1M entities

**Test Results:**
| Scale | Collisions | Mean Latency | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| 1K | 0 (0.0%) | 0.000158ms | ✓ PASS |
| 10K | 0 (0.0%) | 0.000211ms | ✓ PASS |
| 100K | 0 (0.0%) | 0.000665ms | ✓ PASS |
| 1M | 0 (0.0%) | 0.000526ms | ✓ PASS |

**Key Finding:** Latency scales logarithmically (4.21x for 1000x scale), confirming the "fractal" property.

**Output:** Results saved to `seed/engine/results/exp04_fractal_scaling_<timestamp>.json`

See `EXP04_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` for full analysis.

## Next Steps After Phase 1 Pass

3. **Run Phase 2 experiments** (EXP-04: Fractal Scaling) ✓ DONE
