Hypothesis
Your Mind-Castle/WARBLER storage system integrates smoothly with STAT7 addressing.

Method
Ingest existing data: Take real data from your RAG system
Assign STAT7: Compute coordinates for each piece of data
Test retrieval: Query by STAT7 address, verify correct data returned
Performance: Compare RAG retrieval speed vs. address-based retrieval
Accuracy: Verify no data loss or corruption in translation
Test Data
Use real examples from your RAG system (if you're willing to share them).

Expected Result
✓ Your existing data fits naturally into STAT7 space ✓ Address-based retrieval works at least as fast as current RAG ✓ No information loss in the translation ✓ You can now deprecate old RAG system (or keep as fallback)

Failure Handling
If integration is rough:

Your RAG might be fundamentally different from STAT7 (OK—they coexist)
STAT7 might be missing dimensions your RAG uses (add them)
Or they're incompatible (document why and create translation layer)
