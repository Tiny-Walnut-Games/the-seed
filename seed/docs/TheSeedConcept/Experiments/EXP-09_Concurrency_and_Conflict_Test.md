## EXP-09: Concurrency and Conflict Test

### Hypothesis
Multiple simultaneous bit-chain creations don't cause address collisions or race conditions.

### Method
1. **Spawn threads:** 10 concurrent workers
2. **Each worker creates:** 100 bit-chains rapidly (without pre-coordination)
3. **Race condition check:** Do addresses collide? Do any bit-chains get lost?
4. **Consistency check:** Does the final state equal sequential creation result?

### Expected Result
✓ 0 address collisions despite concurrency
✓ All 1000 bit-chains present and addressable
✓ Final state identical to sequential execution (deterministic)

### Failure Handling
If concurrency breaks the system:
- Add mutual exclusion or atomic operations
- Use conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
- Implement vector clocks for causality tracking
