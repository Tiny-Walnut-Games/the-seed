## EXP-10: Narrative Preservation Test

### Hypothesis
The Seed can preserve semantic meaning/narrative alongside raw data storage.

### Method
1. **Create story-based bit-chains:** 10 related decisions forming a narrative
2. **Store with narrative context:** Each has `narrative_role` field explaining its story
3. **Retrieve full story:** Query related bit-chains, reconstruct narrative arc
4. **Semantic check:** Does the reconstructed story make sense?

### Example
```
Bit-Chain A: Decision to use immutable state
  → Narrative role: "The Turning Point: We realized mutation was causing chaos"

Bit-Chain B: Test coverage increased to 95%
  → Narrative role: "The Validation: Tests proved immutability worked"

Bit-Chain C: Performance improved 3x
  → Narrative role: "The Revelation: Immutability was also faster"

Query: "Tell me the story of why we chose immutability"
Result: [A → B → C], with full narrative reconstruction
```

### Expected Result
✓ Narrative context is preserved through retrieval
✓ Story threads can be followed across bit-chains
✓ Meaning is not lost in addressing/compression

### Failure Handling
If narrative is lost:
- `narrative_role` field might be too simple
- Need richer metadata (emotion, importance, consequence)
- Or Realm="narrative" bit-chains need special handling
