# 🔐 Security Work Summary: EXP-05 & Seed Compression

> **What's been done, what needs to be done, and why it matters**

---

## The Situation

You built a compression system (EXP-05) that:
- ✅ Compresses data losslessly
- ✅ Preserves provenance perfectly
- ✅ Preserves narrative/meaning
- ✅ Works mathematically

But:
- ❌ Has **NO authentication on recovery operations**
- ❌ Has **NO access control** (anyone can expand)
- ❌ Combined with badge data = **identity theft vulnerability**

Your imposter was **100% correct** to flag this. This is a real security issue.

## What's Been Created for You

### 📄 Three New Security Documents

#### 1. **EXP-05-SECURITY-ASSESSMENT.md** (Updated)
- **What:** Complete security analysis of the vulnerability
- **Length:** ~550 lines
- **Includes:**
  - Executive summary (5 min read)
  - Complete threat model
  - Eagle-Eye attack scenario (step-by-step)
  - Phase 1/2/3 fix recommendations
  - Security checklist before production
  - Why the existing security layer covers storage but NOT recovery

**Key insight:** "Fort with perfect walls and locks, but front door is open"

**Read time:** ~30 minutes

**When:** Before implementing fixes (understand what you're protecting against)

---

#### 2. **DOCTRINE-INTEGRITY-SECURITY-SCROLLS.md** (NEW)
- **What:** Map Story Test archetypes to security patterns
- **Length:** ~450 lines
- **Includes:**
  - Phantom Prop = fabricated data
  - Cold Method = unguarded recovery path
  - Hollow Enum = policy without enforcement
  - Premature Celebration = audit logged too late
  - Real code examples for each archetype
  - Integration guide for your team
  - Example: RecoveryGate class implementation

**Why it exists:** So your team doesn't learn a NEW security language; they apply EXISTING patterns (Story Test) to data integrity.

**Read time:** ~25 minutes

**When:** Before code review (team should know these patterns)

---

#### 3. **SECURITY-RUNBOOK-EXP05.md** (NEW)
- **What:** Step-by-step implementation guide
- **Length:** ~550 lines (working code provided)
- **Includes:**
  - Phase 1: This week (CRITICAL) — 13.5 hours of work
  - Phase 2: Next two weeks — 16 hours of work
  - Phase 3: This month (optional) — 24 hours of work
  - Exact code to write for each step
  - Tests to run for each step
  - Checklist before production

**What you need to do:**
1. Add `data_classification` field to BitChain
2. Create `RecoveryGate` class with auth checks
3. Implement ACL enforcement
4. Add audit logging
5. Write tests for all four archetypes
6. Run Eagle-Eye attack test

**Read time:** ~20 minutes (then implement)

**When:** Start implementing immediately (Phase 1 this week)

## How to Use These Documents

### For You (Decision Maker)

1. **Read:** EXP-05-SECURITY-ASSESSMENT.md (Executive Summary section, 5 min)
2. **Decide:** Do we implement Phase 1 this week? (Yes, if badge data is on Seed)
3. **Allocate:** 13.5 hours of dev time for Phase 1
4. **Track:** Use SECURITY-RUNBOOK-EXP05.md checklist

### For Your Dev Team

1. **Read:** DOCTRINE-INTEGRITY-SECURITY-SCROLLS.md (20 min)
   - Learn the four archetypes
   - Understand why they matter
   - See code examples

2. **Code:** SECURITY-RUNBOOK-EXP05.md (follow steps 1.1 → 1.6)
   - Each step has code + tests
   - Run tests after each step
   - Check off the checklist

3. **Test:** Run Eagle-Eye attack scenario
   - If attacker denied → ✅ Security works
   - If attacker succeeds → ❌ Back to code

4. **Review:** Use DOCTRINE-INTEGRITY-SECURITY-SCROLLS.md as checklist
   - Every recovery operation checked for all four archetypes?
   - Tests cover all four archetypes?
   - No "pass-through" paths?

### For Code Review

**Questions to ask:**

**Phantom Prop:**
- Does this verify data actually exists?
- Are signatures checked?
- Could fabricated data slip through?

**Cold Method:**
- Is authentication required?
- Is it checked BEFORE the risky action?
- Can this be called in an unauthorized context?

**Hollow Enum:**
- Is the policy enforced in CODE (not just docs)?
- What happens if policy check fails?
- Is there a "pass-through" that skips the check?

**Premature Celebration:**
- When is logging done vs. when is data returned?
- What happens if process crashes mid-recovery?
- Is audit entry immutable/signed?

## Key Insights

### Why This Matters

Your compression system is **mathematically sound**. But identity recovery isn't just about math—it's about **access control**.

**Example attack:**
```
1. Attacker intercepts Sarah's compressed badge data
2. Attacker runs: recovered = expand(compressed_data)
3. Recovered contains: GitHub handle + achievement history + timestamps
4. Attacker now knows exactly what code Sarah wrote
5. Attacker uses this for social engineering / recruitment / competitor intel
```

**Defense:**
```
1. Attacker intercepts badge data
2. Attacker runs: expanded = recover(badge, token=None)
3. ❌ DENIED: "Authentication required"
4. Attacker tries: expanded = recover(badge, token="fake")
5. ❌ DENIED: "Invalid token" + audit logged
6. Attacker tries bulk extraction (100 badges)
7. ❌ DENIED: "Rate limit exceeded" + security alert
8. Attack logged, analyzed, blocked ✅
```

### The Architecture is Sound

You're not redesigning Seed. You're adding a **security door** to the vault:

```
BEFORE: ┌─────────────────────────┐
        │ Perfect Vault           │
        │ (Crypto, signing, etc)  │
        │ ← But door is OPEN      │
        └─────────────────────────┘

AFTER:  ┌─────────────────────────┐
        │ Perfect Vault           │
        │ (Crypto, signing, etc)  │
        ├─ Door: Auth Required ✅ │
        ├─ ACL Check ✅           │
        ├─ Audit Trail ✅         │
        └─────────────────────────┘
```

### Why Story Test Archetypes Work

You already have mental models for:
- **Phantom Prop:** "This data arrived but doesn't belong"
- **Cold Method:** "This code doesn't know its context"
- **Hollow Enum:** "This is declared but not enforced"
- **Premature Celebration:** "We celebrated before finishing"

These patterns work for **narrative integrity** (game debugging) AND **data integrity** (security). Your team doesn't need to learn new language—just apply existing patterns to a new domain.

## FAQ

**Q: Do we HAVE to do this?**
A: If badge data (GitHub handles + achievement history) goes through Seed compression, YES. It's PII and attackable. If only non-sensitive data, Phase 1 is lighter but still recommended.

**Q: How much time?**
A: Phase 1 = 13.5 hours. Phase 2 = 16 hours. Total impact on sprint: ~40 hours if you do Phase 1 + 2 + 3. You can skip Phase 3 (nice-to-have).

**Q: Can we skip Phase 1?**
A: Only if badge data NEVER goes through Seed. If you ever compress badges, Phase 1 is mandatory.

**Q: What if we ship without this?**
A: Attacker can extract complete dev profiles (name, skills, achievement history, companies worked for) just by intercepting badge data. Social engineering target list + competitive intelligence in one vector. Not recommended.

**Q: Does this slow down performance?**
A: Phase 1 adds ~10ms per recovery (auth checks + audit append). Acceptable. Phase 2 adds rate limiting (minimal). Phase 3 adds differential privacy (varies by implementation).

**Q: Can we use an external security firm?**
A: Phase 3 includes penetration testing. Recommended for production. Not needed for Phase 1/2 if you follow the runbook exactly.
