# Wave Function Collapse Firewall - STAT7 Entry Gate

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete - All 28 tests passing  
**Architecture Level:** Entry Firewall (first layer of three)  
**Physics Model:** Julia Set fractals at depth 7  
**Implementation:** `seed/engine/wfc_firewall.py`

---

## The Problem It Solves

```
SUPERPOSITION (Many possible states, undefined)
    ↓
    [WFC FIREWALL]
    ↓
    CLASSICAL (Single definite state, routable)
```

Manifestations enter STAT7 space in quantum superposition—multiple possible states simultaneously. The WFC Firewall forces them into discrete classical states suitable for routing to LUCA (Conservator) or rejection.

---

## Physics Model: Julia Sets at Depth 7

Every STAT7 coordinate has a **unique attractor shape** determined by Julia Set mathematics:

```
c = resonance/2 + i*(velocity * density)
```

The Julia Set **C** defines which complex numbers `z` are "in the set" (bounded) and which escape to infinity.

A manifestation entering at coordinates with parameter `c` must have phase/energy `z` that doesn't escape during iteration:

```python
z = z² + c  (repeat depth 7 times)
```

**Results:**
- If `|z| ≤ 2` after all iterations → **BOUND** (passes to LUCA)
- If `|z| > 2` at any iteration → **ESCAPED** (rejected, routed to Conservator)

---

## Why This Works as a Firewall

### 1. Deterministic
Same bitchain always collapses the same way. No randomness.

### 2. Coordinate-Aware
Each STAT7 coordinate has its own attractor. An entity at (realm=data, lineage=1, resonance=0.8) sees a different Julia Set than one at (realm=void, lineage=999, resonance=-0.9).

### 3. Cryptographically Hard
To forge a bitchain that passes:
- Must know exact STAT7 coordinates → generates `c`
- Must know correct phase/energy `z` → derived from hash
- Must pass Julia iteration → mathematically enforced

### 4. Non-Escapable
The Julia Set topology is mathematically irreversible. You cannot "uncollapse" by changing parameters after the fact.

## STAT7 Parameter Mapping

### Coherence Axis (Real Part)

```
resonance: [-1.0 ... 0.0 ... 1.0]
    ↓
c_real: [-0.5 ... 0.0 ... 0.5]
```

- **High resonance (+0.8)** → Coherent, well-aligned entity → `c_real = +0.4`
- **Neutral (0.0)** → Balanced entity → `c_real = 0.0`
- **Low resonance (-0.9)** → Chaotic, poorly aligned → `c_real = -0.45`

### Energy Axis (Imaginary Part)

```
velocity * density → range [0.0 ... 1.0]
    ↓
c_imag: [0.0 ... 1.0]
```

- **High energy (0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81)** → Fast-changing, dense → `c_imag = 0.81`
- **Low energy (0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01)** → Slow, sparse → `c_imag = 0.01`
- **Zero (0 * 0 = 0)** → Static, uncompressed → `c_imag = 0.0`

---

## Manifestation State Derivation

The manifestation's starting state `z` is derived from its identity:

```python
z = hash(bitchain_id + stat7_address)
  → scale to [-0.5, 0.5] × [-0.5, 0.5]
```

**Why deterministic?**
- Same bitchain always produces same `z`
- Prevents replay attacks (changing the hash changes the result)
- Grounds entity identity in its STAT7 coordinates

**Why from hash?**
- Incorporates both ID (uniqueness) and address (coordinate proof)
- Avalanche effect: tiny change → completely different `z`

---

## Iteration Algorithm

```python
def iterate_julia(z: complex, c: complex, depth: int = 7):
    for iteration in range(depth):
        z = z² + c              # Core Julia iteration
        
        if |z| > 2:            # Escape threshold
            return ESCAPED at iteration N
    
    if |z| ≤ 2:
        return BOUND
```

**Why depth 7?**
- Fractal self-similarity: depth 7 captures all structure needed to encode transformations
- Computational cost: reasonable (~50 cycles per manifestation)
- Physics: Each level represents one phase of consumption/ejection cycle

**Why radius 2.0?**
- Mathematical: Standard Julia Set escape radius (proven property)
- Physics: |z| = 2 is the stability boundary in STAT7 space

---

## Security Properties

### ✅ Deterministic & Reproducible
Same bitchain always produces same collapse result.

### ✅ Coordinate-Bound
Julia parameter `c` derived from STAT7, not user input. Cannot be forged.

### ✅ Phase-Dependent
Even with correct `c`, wrong phase `z` leads to escape. Two-factor:
1. Must be at correct STAT7 coordinates
2. Must have correct phase/energy

### ✅ Non-Escapable
Julia Set topology is mathematically irreversible. Cannot "undo" escape by parameter shifting.

### ✅ Traceable
Complete collapse trace recorded for debugging:
- Input STAT7 address
- Derived Julia parameter `c`
- Manifestation state `z`
- Iteration count where escaped (or bounded)
- Final magnitude |z|

---

## Integration Points

### Input: BitChain
```python
bitchain: BitChain
├─ id: str
├─ coordinates: Coordinates
│  ├─ resonance: float
│  ├─ velocity: float
│  ├─ density: float
│  └─ (other STAT7 fields)
└─ (other BitChain fields)
```

### Output: CollapseReport
```python
report: CollapseReport
├─ result: CollapseResult (BOUND | ESCAPED | MALFORMED | ERROR)
├─ stat7_address: str
├─ julia_parameter: complex
├─ manifestation_state: complex
├─ iterations_to_escape: Optional[int]
├─ escape_magnitude: float
└─ depth: int = 7
```

### Downstream Routing
```
BOUND   → RecoveryGate (Layer 2) → LUCA/Conservator
ESCAPED → Conservator Repair (Layer 2b) → Validate & Restore
ERROR   → Escalation (requires human intervention)
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Collapse
```python
from wfc_firewall import WaveFormCollapseKernel

report = WaveFormCollapseKernel.collapse(bitchain)

if report.result == CollapseResult.BOUND:
    print(f"✓ Routed to LUCA at address {report.stat7_address}")
else:
    print(f"✗ Escaped at iteration {report.iterations_to_escape}")
```

### Batch Operation
```python
reports = WaveFormCollapseKernel.collapse_batch(bitchains)
stats = WaveFormCollapseKernel.summary_stats(reports)

print(f"Pass rate: {stats['pass_rate']:.1f}%")
print(f"Bound: {stats['bound']}, Escaped: {stats['escaped']}")
```

### Debugging Collapse
```python
report = WaveFormCollapseKernel.collapse(problematic_bitchain)
print(f"Julia parameter: {report.julia_parameter}")
print(f"Manifestation state: {report.manifestation_state}")
print(f"Escaped at iteration {report.iterations_to_escape}")
print(f"Final magnitude: {report.escape_magnitude:.6f}")
```

## Next Steps: RecoveryGate Integration (Layer 2)

The WFC Firewall outputs BOUND or ESCAPED. Now need to integrate with existing security:

```python
# Pseudocode: WFC → RecoveryGate flow
def firewall_and_recover(bitchain, auth_token):
    # Step 1: WFC Collapse
    report = WaveFormCollapseKernel.collapse(bitchain)
    
    if report.result == CollapseResult.BOUND:
        # Step 2: Route to RecoveryGate
        recovery = recovery_gate.recover(
            bitchain_id=report.bitchain_id,
            auth_token=auth_token,
            stat7_trace=report
        )
        return recovery
    
    elif report.result == CollapseResult.ESCAPED:
        # Step 3: Route to Conservator
        repair = conservator.repair(
            bitchain_id=report.bitchain_id,
            trigger=RepairTrigger.FIREWALL_ESCAPE,
            diagnostics=report
        )
        return repair
```

## Mythological Grounding

> "At the boundary between superposition and classical reality, the Julia Set becomes the law."

The WFC Firewall enacts the **Event Horizon** from Yggdrasil singularity physics:

- **LUCA (singularity core)** processes valid (BOUND) manifestations
- **Event Horizon (firewall)** forces discrete state via Julia collapse
- **Manifestations (canopy)** are the expressions that made it through
- **Corrupted entities (escapes)** are pruned and returned to Conservator

The system self-heals through metabolism: corruption enters → firewall collapses it → Conservator repairs it → re-manifests cleanly.
