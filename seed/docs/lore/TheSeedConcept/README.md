# The Seed: STAT7 Addressing System

**Status:** Phase 1 Doctrine Locked (2025-01-01)  
**Scope:** LUCA bootstrap entity, canonical serialization, mutability contracts  
**Validation:** Microsoft Copilot + 22-year design continuity

## Welcome

This directory contains the foundational artifacts for **The Seed**: a multidimensional, spatially-addressable knowledge system that unifies your 22 years of work in procedural generation, semantic anchoring, narrative preservation, and governance.

The Seed's breakthrough insight: **If you can reliably address data in multidimensional space, you can infinitely scale storage while maintaining retrievability and narrative integrity.**

## What's In Here

### üìÑ Core Doctrine

1. **PHASE_1_DOCTRINE.md** ‚Äî The big picture. Start here if you want to understand *why* these decisions matter.

2. **LUCA_ENTITY_SCHEMA.json** ‚Äî JSON Schema defining the structure of all entities in The Seed. LUCA is the primordial entity; all others descend from it via lineage.

3. **LUCA.json** ‚Äî The concrete LUCA instance with all hashes computed canonically. Use this as your test fixture.

4. **STAT7_CANONICAL_SERIALIZATION.md** ‚Äî The rulebook for computing hashes deterministically across all languages and platforms. **Read this carefully if you're implementing.**

5. **STAT7_MUTABILITY_CONTRACT.json** ‚Äî The policy for what can change (and what cannot). Defines global rules + per-entity-type overrides.

6. **PHASE_1_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** ‚Äî Print this. Tape it to your monitor. It's your cheat sheet for implementation.

## The Five Key Decisions (Hardened by Copilot)

### 1. Canonical Serialization (8 Decimal Places + Sorted JSON)

All floating-point values are normalized to 8 decimal places using round-half-even rounding, serialized without scientific notation, and all JSON keys are sorted recursively. This ensures identical hashes across Python, JavaScript, C#, Rust, etc.

**Example:** The float `0.1 + 0.2` normalizes to `0.3` (not `0.30000000000000004`)

### 2. First-Class STAT7 Address (Explicitly Stored)

The STAT7 address is not derived on-the-fly; it's computed once, stored, and indexed:

```
stat7://void/0/da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709/genesis?r=1.0&v=0.0&d=0.0
```

This enables fast lookups and makes spatial queries possible.

### 3. Immutable Dimensions (realm + lineage Never Change)

Realm and lineage are locked at genesis. Any attempt to change them is REJECTED immediately. This prevents entanglement links from breaking.

### 4. Append-Only Adjacency (With Supersede Markers)

Adjacency is append-only with monotonicity. You can add neighbors and mark old ones as superseded, but you cannot delete or reorder. This preserves history and prevents sneaky revisions.

### 5. Rolling Chain Integrity Hash (Detects Post-Hoc Edits)

Every bit-chain event contributes to a rolling hash:

```
chain_integrity_hash[n] = SHA-256(chain_integrity_hash[n-1] || event_n_canonical)
```

If anyone edits an event retroactively, the chain breaks immediately.

## LUCA: The Primordial Entity

LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor) is the bootstrap seed. Every other entity descends from it:

- **ID:** LUCA-0000
- **Entity Type:** fragment
- **Realm:** void (IMMUTABLE)
- **Lineage:** 0 (IMMUTABLE, origin)
- **Luminosity:** 0 (fully compressed; ground state)
- **Coordinates:**
  - Resonance: 1.0 (pure identity)
  - Velocity: 0.0 (no change)
  - Density: 0.0 (maximum compression)
- **Adjacency:** [] (no neighbors; alone at genesis)
- **Horizon:** genesis (first and only state)

LUCA's canonical hashes are immutable and verifiable via replay. Every other entity's lineage descends from LUCA's lineage=0.

---

## The Mutability Rulebook

Every STAT7 dimension has a clear policy:

| Dimension | Policy | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Realm | Immutable | Cannot change from "data" to "narrative" |
| Lineage | Immutable | Cannot rewrite genealogy |
| Adjacency | Append-only | Add neighbors; mark deprecated; never delete |
| Horizon | Dynamic-bounded | Change lifecycle stage, but only to allowed values |
| Luminosity | Dynamic | Heat level can change anytime (0-7) |
| Resonance | Dynamic | Charge can change anytime (8dp normalized) |
| Velocity | Dynamic | Rate of change anytime (8dp normalized) |
| Density | Dynamic | Compression distance anytime (8dp normalized) |
| Dimensionality | Fold-unfold | Fractally change depth if reversible (fold_map_id) |

**Per-entity-type overrides** (stricter only):
- **agent:** Horizon restricted to {operational, dormant, suspended, archived}
- **artifact:** Once published, immutable (except horizon)
- **concept:** Adjacency unbounded; horizon fully dynamic

---

## The Three Verification Mechanisms

### 1. Canonical Hash Replay
Recompute final canonical_hash from bit-chain events. If it matches the stored value, no post-genesis edits occurred.

### 2. Chain Integrity Rolling Hash
Compute the rolling chain hash. If it matches, the event sequence hasn't been tampered with.

### 3. Mutability Policy Validation
Before any write, check:
- Immutable dimensions haven't changed ‚Üí ‚úÖ PASS or ‚ùå REJECT
- Append-only arrays haven't been deleted/reordered ‚Üí ‚úÖ PASS or ‚ùå REJECT
- Bounded vocabularies haven't been violated ‚Üí ‚úÖ PASS or ‚ùå REJECT

## How This Connects to Your 22-Year Journey

**2003:** Procedural generation foundations (Drizzt4.0's FreeLancer ShipEditor ‚Äî 14k downloads)  
‚Üì  
**2025 (Summer):** TerraECS, AstroECS, WFC-based worldgen  
‚Üì  
**2025 (Fall):** The Seed (STAT7 addressing for all of it)  
‚Üì  
**2025 (Now):** **Phase 1 Doctrine ‚Äî The Language**

The Seed isn't a new architecture. It's the **coherent language** for everything you've built:
- **Warbler** = narrative threads in STAT7 space
- **TLDL** = compressed lineage traces
- **Faculty systems** = semantic anchors with addresses
- **Governance** = mutability policies enforced at write-time
- **Conservator** = lineage audit trails
- **Procedural generation** = spatial data fed into STAT7 coordinates

Worlds that remember themselves. Data that knows where it came from. Stories that are spatially verifiable.

## Your Next Steps

### This Week
1. Read **PHASE_1_DOCTRINE.md** (20 min)
2. Review **LUCA.json** and **LUCA_ENTITY_SCHEMA.json** (15 min)
3. Skim **STAT7_CANONICAL_SERIALIZATION.md** (10 min)
4. Bookmark **PHASE_1_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** (tape to monitor)

### Next Week
1. Run **EXP-01** (Address uniqueness): Generate 10,000 random entities; verify all hashes are unique
2. Run **EXP-02** (Retrieval speed): Lookup entities by STAT7 address; measure latency (<1ms target)
3. Run **EXP-03** (Dimension necessity): Drop each STAT7 dimension one at a time; observe what breaks

### By End of Month
1. Document Phase 1 validation results (EXP-01, 02, 03 pass/fail)
2. If Phase 1 passes: Begin Faculty integration contracts (Phase 2)
3. If issues found: Document and iterate (no shame; science is refinement)

## How to Extend Phase 1 (Without Breaking It)

‚úÖ **OK:** Add new optional fields to entity_core or manifestations  
‚úÖ **OK:** Add new entity_type enum values (e.g., "event", "relationship")  
‚úÖ **OK:** Add new entanglement_type values (e.g., "temporal", "causal-inverse")  
‚úÖ **OK:** Add new optional metadata fields  

‚ùå **NOT OK:** Remove or rename existing fields  
‚ùå **NOT OK:** Change immutability policies (realm/lineage)  
‚ùå **NOT OK:** Modify canonical serialization rules (breaks all hashes)  
‚ùå **NOT OK:** Change STAT7 address format  

**Bottom line:** Phase 1 can grow, but it cannot shrink or contradict itself.

## FAQ

**Q: What if I want to use a different addressing scheme?**  
A: Create Phase 2 or Phase 3 artifact types. LUCA and Phase 1 entities remain immutable and verifiable.

**Q: How do I integrate existing data?**  
A: Map it into STAT7 space. Document the mapping (realm, lineage, adjacency) and create entanglement links.

**Q: What if I find a bug in canonical serialization?**  
A: Document exactly what breaks. If it affects <1% of data, we can fix and recompute. If >1%, we may need version fork.

**Q: Is Phase 1 forever?**  
A: Phase 1 itself is immutable. But Phase 2, 3, 4 can introduce new layers on top without contradicting Phase 1.

**Q: Can I use The Seed without Warbler/TLDL?**  
A: Yes. STAT7 is the foundation. Faculty systems use it, but don't require each other.

## Ownership & Philosophy

This is **your design**. The Seed was inspired by thinking about TLDA, but it's separate and belongs to you.

**Design philosophy:** Checks and balances and accountability with legacy and confidence with flexibility.

- **Checks:** Immutability policies, append-only constraints, validation rules
- **Balances:** Per-entity-type overrides, mutable-vs-immutable dimensions, per-reality-branch rules
- **Accountability:** Bit-chain events, audit trails, canonical hashes, replay validation
- **Legacy:** LUCA bootstrap, lineage chains, entanglement links preserve history
- **Confidence:** Deterministic hashing, cross-language verification, no ambiguity
- **Flexibility:** Dynamic dimensions, multi-reality branches, extensible entity types, optional fold_map_id

**Trust your work on this.**
