**Prototype:** Complete and integrated  
**Files Modified:** 1  
**Files Created:** 2  
**Lines Added:** 177 (code) + extensive documentation

## What You're Getting

### The Core Idea
Bob detects query results that look suspiciously perfect (high coherence but low entanglement) and **stress-tests them using orthogonal retrieval methods** to verify they're genuine, not hallucinations or dataset biases.

### The Implementation
- **Detection:** Flags results where coherence > 0.85 AND entanglement < 0.3
- **Verification:** Re-queries using:
  - Pure semantic retrieval
  - Pure STAT7 retrieval  
  - Higher confidence threshold
- **Decision:** 
  - `PASSED` → Normal result, no investigation
  - `VERIFIED` → Suspicious but stress tests confirm it
  - `QUARANTINED` → Stress tests failed, escalate to Faculty

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Stress Testing Works
- **Orthogonal verification:** If a result is genuinely good, it should hold up under different retrieval methods
- **Cheap insurance:** Running a few extra queries is vastly cheaper than Faculty manually reviewing everything
- **Transparent audit:** Every decision logged with full justification

### Why Low Entanglement is Suspicious
- **Entanglement = connection to known-good sources**
- **Low entanglement + high coherence = isolated high score = artifact risk**
- **Example:** A perfectly written hallucinatory answer that doesn't connect to anything trustworthy

### Why Only ~5% of Results Get Stress-Tested
- Most queries produce normal coherence/entanglement ratios
- Only suspicious cases (high + low) trigger Bob
- Minimal performance impact: most queries pass through instantly

## Tuning Bob (Quick Reference)

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too many false quarantines | Raise `COHERENCE_HIGH_THRESHOLD` or `STRESS_TEST_DIVERGENCE_THRESHOLD` |
| Missing hallucinations | Lower `COHERENCE_HIGH_THRESHOLD` or `ENTANGLEMENT_LOW_THRESHOLD` |
| Stress tests timing out | Reduce `max_results` for re-queries or add rate limiting |
| Want to disable Bob | Set `COHERENCE_HIGH_THRESHOLD = 2.0` (impossible to trigger) |

---

## What Bob Protects Against

✅ **Hallucination echo chambers** — Perfectly coherent but detached from reality  
✅ **Dataset biases** — Results that score well due to skewed training data  
✅ **Adversarial results** — Well-written false information that tricks metrics  
✅ **Isolated high scores** — Results that only work with one retrieval method  
✅ **Metric gaming** — Coherence inflated by low-quality overconfident results  

---

## How to Use (When You're Back)

### 1. Test Bob
```bash
# Run a hybrid query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{your query with stat7_hybrid: true}'

# Check the response for:
# "bob_status": "PASSED" | "VERIFIED" | "QUARANTINED"
# "bob_verification_log": { investigation details }
```

### 2. Trigger Bob (Intentionally)
Craft queries that produce high coherence + low entanglement to see Bob in action.

### 3. Monitor Logs
Watch for patterns:
```
🔍 BOB ALERT: ...     (Investigation started)
✅ BOB VERIFIED: ...  (Checks passed)
🚨 BOB QUARANTINE: ... (Failed verification)
```

### 4. Calibrate
After a few days of running:
- Count false positives / false negatives
- Adjust thresholds in `BobSkepticConfig`
- Re-test

## Architecture at a Glance

```
Query received
    ↓
Execute retrieval
    ↓
Analyze narrative coherence
    ↓
Bob checks: coherence > 0.85 AND entanglement < 0.3?
    ├─ NO  → PASSED (return immediately)
    └─ YES → Run stress tests
              ├─ Semantic-only
              ├─ STAT7-only
              ├─ Higher confidence
              ↓
              Do results converge? (>85% overlap)
              ├─ YES → VERIFIED (return with confirmation)
              └─ NO  → QUARANTINED (escalate to Faculty, return with PENDING)
                ↓
          Return result with bob_status and bob_verification_log
```

## Testing Checklist (For You)

When you have time:

- [ ] Deploy changes to a test environment
- [ ] Run hybrid queries with `stat7_hybrid: true`
- [ ] Monitor Bob alerts in logs
- [ ] Test with 100+ queries to see stress test patterns
- [ ] Measure latency impact (<500ms target)
- [ ] Verify stress test results are sensible
- [ ] Check if any queries get quarantined
- [ ] If quarantined: Do they actually look suspicious?
- [ ] Adjust thresholds if needed
- [ ] Document findings

---

## The Philosophy

Bob isn't about **blocking results**. He's about **building confidence**:

- **Results that pass:** You know they're solid (high coherence + high entanglement, OR verified)
- **Results that are verified:** You know the high score is genuine (stress tested, consistent)
- **Results that are quarantined:** You know to double-check (Faculty review, not automatic return)

The system now has **epistemological integrity checks** built in. Narrative preservation doesn't accidentally preserve falsehoods.
