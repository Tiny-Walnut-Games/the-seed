# The Seed Documentation Rewrite Plan
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Goal:** Replace 48-file bloat with GitBook-style coherence + zero false celebrations  
**Timeline:** 3 focused editing sessions (this session → next session → polish)

---

## Current State (Problem Summary)

**48 markdown files** sprawled across **8 subdirectories** with:
- ❌ **10 redundant docs** in CheckCelebrationStatus/ all saying the same thing
- ❌ **5 copies** of "Phase 1 validation complete" across different files
- ❌ **Celebratory language** without specifying runtime status (can tests actually execute?)
- ❌ **No single source of truth** for "what's actually done?"
- ✅ **Good underlying work** (EXP-01 through EXP-05 genuinely complete)

**Result:** Reader confusion. High effort to determine actual status.

---

## Target State (GitBook Structure)

Replace sprawl with **clarity through hierarchy:**

## Phase 1: Audit & Planning (✅ Complete)

**Done:**
- ✅ Validated all Phase 1-2 experiments (EXP-01 through EXP-05)
- ✅ Identified false celebrations (CheckCelebrationStatus/ redundancy)
- ✅ Inventory all 48 files + assessed necessity
- ✅ Found EXP-05 security vulnerability
- ✅ Classified STAT7→NFT conversion as 40% complete (experimental)
- ✅ Created comprehensive validation audit report

**Deliverable:** `AUDIT_VALIDATION_REPORT_2025-10-19.md` (👈 read this first)

---

## Phase 2: Core Rewrite (This Session)

### Step 1: Create New `index.md` (Master Entrypoint)
**Location:** `seed/docs/TheSeedConcept/index.md`

Replace current `START_HERE.md` with **single, definitive entry point**:

**Content outline:**
- What is The Seed? (3 sentences)
- Quick links to: Philosophy / Implementation / Status / Roadmap / API / Archive
- "Where to start" flowchart (Are you implementing? Validating? Reading for context?)
- Current status summary table (Phase 1: ✅ Locked | Phase 2: ✅ Foundation | Phase 3: ⏳ Planned)
- Single "Validation Checklist" showing what's proven

### Step 2: Create `status/phase1_validation.md` (Single Source of Truth)
**Location:** `seed/docs/TheSeedConcept/status/phase1_validation.md`

Consolidate all these into ONE:
- `CheckCelebrationStatus/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- `Experiments/EXP04_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- `Experiments/EXP04_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `CheckCelebrationStatus/VALIDATION_RESULTS_20251018_*.json` (embed results)

**Content:**
- Table for EXP-01 through EXP-05 (status, date, file location, key metrics)
- Expandable sections for each experiment with actual JSON results embedded
- Clear flags: "✅ COMPLETE" vs "🟡 EXPERIMENTAL" vs "❌ NOT STARTED"
- Link to security assessment for EXP-05 caveats

### Step 3: Create `status/security_assessment.md`
**Location:** `seed/docs/TheSeedConcept/status/security_assessment.md`

Extract from: `Firewall and Containment/EXP-05-SECURITY-ASSESSMENT.md`

**Content:**
- **Vulnerability Summary:** No access controls on recovery (public provenance + public algorithm)
- **Risk Level:** HIGH (before prod use with real user data)
- **Mitigation:** Add authentication + rate limiting + access control list
- **Timeline:** Block before Badge/Companion system goes live
- **Reference:** Full details in `Firewall and Containment/` docs

### Step 4: Create `status/nft_conversion_progress.md`
**Location:** `seed/docs/TheSeedConcept/status/nft_conversion_progress.md`

Replace all scattered STAT7-NFT docs with ONE progress page:

**Content:**
- Companion status: 40% (scaffolding complete, phase 2-5 pending)
- Badge status: 40% (scaffolding complete, phase 2-5 pending)
- What exists vs what's TODO
- Clear `[EXPERIMENTAL - Not for production use]` warning at top
- Link to `api/stat7_companion.md` and `api/stat7_badge.md` for technical details

### Step 5: Restructure `status/` folder
**Delete:** All redundant docs from CheckCelebrationStatus/  
**Keep:** `Firewall and Containment/` as security reference  
**Move:** Archive originals to `archive/CheckCelebrationStatus/` as backup

### Step 6: Update `README.md` in each section
Create **navigation README files** for:
- `philosophy/README.md` — "Read these to understand why"
- `implementation/README.md` — "Read these to build"
- `status/README.md` — "Read these to know what works"
- `roadmap/README.md` — "Read these to see what's next"
- `api/README.md` — "Read these to use it"
- `archive/README.md` — "Legacy docs; mostly historical"

---

## Phase 3: Polish & Validation (Next Session)

### Step 1: Delete 10+ Redundant Files
From `CheckCelebrationStatus/`:
- `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` → archived
- `INTEGRATION-COMPLETE-PHASE2.md` → archived (premature)
- `INTEGRATION-SESSION-SUMMARY.md` → archived
- `VALIDATION_EXPERIMENTS_README.md` → consolidated into `status/phase1_validation.md`
- Similar consolidation for STRESS_TEST files

### Step 2: Update Cross-References
- `philosophy/README.md` → Link to `implementation/Roadmaps/`
- `implementation/README.md` → Link to actual code in `seed/engine/`
- `status/README.md` → Link to `archive/` for historical context
- `roadmap/README.md` → Link to GitHub issues for each EXP-06 through EXP-10

### Step 3: Validation
- [ ] Can someone understand current status from `status/phase1_validation.md` alone?
- [ ] Are false celebrations gone?
- [ ] Is "40% experimental" clear enough that Badge/Companion won't ship prematurely?
- [ ] Does the security vulnerability stand out clearly?

### Step 4: Create Navigation Index
Update main `index.md` with auto-generated table of contents (if using GitBook)

## Files to Create (This Session)

| File | Purpose | Priority | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index.md` | Master entrypoint | 🔴 HIGH | 30 min |
| `philosophy/README.md` | Navigation | 🟡 MEDIUM | 15 min |
| `philosophy/dimensions.md` | What are the 7 STAT7 dimensions? | 🟡 MEDIUM | 20 min |
| `implementation/README.md` | Navigation | 🟡 MEDIUM | 15 min |
| `status/README.md` | Navigation | 🟡 MEDIUM | 15 min |
| `status/phase1_validation.md` | **CRITICAL** (replaces 5 docs) | 🔴 HIGH | 45 min |
| `status/security_assessment.md` | Flag EXP-05 vulnerability | 🔴 HIGH | 30 min |
| `status/nft_conversion_progress.md` | Companion/Badge status | 🟡 MEDIUM | 20 min |
| `roadmap/README.md` | Navigation | 🟡 MEDIUM | 15 min |
| `roadmap/phase1_locked.md` | What's immutable | 🟡 MEDIUM | 20 min |
| `roadmap/phase2_foundation.md` | What needs hardening | 🟡 MEDIUM | 20 min |
| `api/README.md` | Navigation | 🟡 MEDIUM | 15 min |
| `archive/README.md` | Legacy docs notice | 🟠 LOW | 10 min |

**Total Effort (This Session):** ~3.5 hours (or split across multiple sessions)

---

## Files to Delete/Archive (Phase 3)

| File | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `CheckCelebrationStatus/*` (all 10) | Archive to `archive/` | Redundant |
| `Conversations/*` (all 6) | Archive to `archive/` | Historical debate, not actionable |
| `DEEP_DIVE_MAP.md` | Archive | Absorbed into `status/phase1_validation.md` |
| `START_HERE.md` | Replace | Superseded by new `index.md` |
| Duplicate status files | Archive | Consolidated to single source of truth |

**Do NOT delete original files** — move to `archive/CheckCelebrationStatus/` as backup.

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **After rewrite, user should be able to:**

1. Open `index.md` → in 2 minutes, understand "what's done, what's not, what's next"
2. Want to validate Phase 1 → open `status/phase1_validation.md` → see all EXP results in ONE place
3. Want implementation details → open `implementation/README.md` → navigate to Roadmaps or Schemas
4. Want to use it → open `api/README.md` → find Companion/Badge modules marked as "experimental"
5. See security concerns → prominently flagged in `status/security_assessment.md`
6. Search for old docs → they're in `archive/` with clear "legacy" marker

❌ **Before rewrite (current state):**
- Reader opens `CheckCelebrationStatus/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `VALIDATION_QUICK_START.md`, `EXP04_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`...
- Still doesn't know if tests actually pass today
- Doesn't understand which files to read
- Sees contradictory celebration language

---

## Ready to Execute?

**This rewrite will:**
- 🎯 Replace sprawl with clarity
- 🎯 Remove all false celebrations
- 🎯 Create single source of truth
- 🎯 Properly flag experimental work
- 🎯 Highlight security concerns
- 🎯 Make navigation obvious

**Questions before we start Phase 2?**
1. Should I create new files in this session, or do you want to review the plan first?
2. Do you want to keep the Conversations/ folder for history, or archive it completely?
3. Should the archive/ folder be `.gitignore`d or kept in repo?

---

**Status:** READY FOR EXECUTION  
**Next Action:** User approval → begin Phase 2 file creation
