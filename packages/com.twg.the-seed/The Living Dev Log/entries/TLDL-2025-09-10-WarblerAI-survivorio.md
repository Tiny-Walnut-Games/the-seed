## Metadata
- Entry ID: TLDL-2025-09-10-WarblerAI-survivorio
- Author: Warbler AI Project Intelligence + Gemma3
- Context: AI-powered project generation for survivor.io
- Summary: Complete project created from natural language request
- Tags: project-setup, warbler-generated, survivor.io, wave-defense, upgrades, survival

## Objective
**User Request:** "Create a survivor.io game"
**AI Interpretation:** survivor.io (moderate complexity)

## AI Analysis Results
### Game Type Detection
- **Type:** survivor.io
- **Complexity:** moderate 
- **Timeline:** 3-5 weeks
- **Architecture:** Component-based with ScriptableObject configs

### Generated Systems
- **PlayerController.cs**: AI-generated playercontroller implementation
- **EnemySpawner.cs**: AI-generated enemyspawner implementation
- **WeaponSystem.cs**: AI-generated weaponsystem implementation
- **UpgradeManager.cs**: AI-generated upgrademanager implementation
- **WaveManager.cs**: AI-generated wavemanager implementation
- **ExperienceManager.cs**: AI-generated experiencemanager implementation
- **HealthSystem.cs**: AI-generated healthsystem implementation
- **DamageSystem.cs**: AI-generated damagesystem implementation

### Key Mechanics Identified
- top-down movement
- automatic shooting
- enemy waves
- experience collection
- upgrade selection
- damage numbers
- procedural spawning

### Folder Structure Created
- Scripts/Player/
- Scripts/Enemies/
- Scripts/Weapons/
- Scripts/Upgrades/
- Scripts/Managers/
- Scripts/UI/
- Scripts/Projectiles/

## Development Roadmap
1. Player movement and basic shooting (Week 1)
2. Enemy spawning and collision (Week 2)
3. Upgrade system and UI (Week 3)
4. Wave progression and balance (Week 4)
5. Polish and optimization (Week 5)

## Testing Strategy
- Performance testing with 100+ enemies
- Upgrade balance testing
- Wave difficulty progression
- Mobile input responsiveness

## Warbler Insights
Survivor.io games require efficient spawning, object pooling, and scalable upgrade systems. Focus on performance optimization and clear visual feedback.

## Next Steps
1. **Review Generated Code**: Examine AI-generated scripts for customization opportunities
2. **Create Prefabs**: Build game objects based on generated system architecture
3. **Configure Scenes**: Set up game scenes according to requirements
4. **Test Integration**: Validate system interactions and performance
5. **Customize & Polish**: Adapt generated code to specific game vision
