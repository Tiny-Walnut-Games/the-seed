# TLDL Entry Template
**Entry ID:** TLDL-2025-08-18-Testingoutthewizardagain
**Author:** @copilot 
**Context:** After showing @Copilot the TLDL that was created, they immediately got to work fixing the issues I mentioned. I am testing wrap around right now and I see that it worked in the Editor. 😁 Emoji's render in the form as well.
**Summary:** So far, testing is good.

## Discoveries

### [Using TLDL as a reference to issues is very helpful]
- **Key Finding**: Think about it. You're writing your log and remember something from a debugging session. so you write it down, like... how I am using really poor grammer and mispelling on purpose to see what happens when I show it to Copilot.  Will it leave it here as evidence or fix it like they did my previous TLDL. That was a nice touch, btw.
- **Impact**: Medium to High
- **Evidence**: TLDL-2025-08-18-Letstestouthteimprovedwizard.md and this log here.
- **Root Cause**: Testing the previous iteration of the wizard... we're going to rebrand it, this form, as `The Scribe`.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Entering data on the form was nice but needed some QOL love.

## Actions Taken

1. **[Tested the log]**
   - **What**: Wrote up a TLDL in the Scribe, previously serialized as TLDL Wizard and provided it as a reference to the Copilot Agent
   - **Why**: Because the TLDL is a living memory bank and Copilot can reference anything in all of them.
   - **How**: Reference just one TLDL and, through the file-path and the breadcrumbs left behind through all of the TLDLs, immediately understand the state of your project. Think of it as being similar to plugging NEO into the training simulator. Instant project ob-barding via one document.
   - **Result**: Faster teamwork. Faster workflow. Higher productivity.
   - **Files Changed**: Products release faster. Teams stay on task. Morale stays high.
   - **Validation**: TLDLWisardWindow.cs

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- We already knew this, but the whole process of developing the Scribe was also a test of the LDA system and TLDL workflow.

### What Could Be Improved
- I just now tested the Preview raw and wrapped mode. The wrapped mode is NOT what I was expecting and there was an obvious misunderstanding. The "wrapped" view was not supposed to be a wrapped view. It is supposed to be a rendering of the markdown as if it was being viewed in GitBooks. That nice, formatted, view where the hashtags actually make things bigger and using -[ ]- creates a tick-box.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
- [ ] Fix the rendering of markdown in the "formatted" preview mode. Ensure the view extends to the bottom of the window just like the raw view does.

### Medium-term Actions (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Consider embedded graphics for the pretty format view.

### Long-term Considerations (Low Priority)
- [ ] Consider creating an interactive window like this for use in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Rider.
