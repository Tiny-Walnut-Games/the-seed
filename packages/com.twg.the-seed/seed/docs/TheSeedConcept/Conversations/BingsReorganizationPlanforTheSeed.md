# Comprehensive Plan for Repairing and Reorganizing a Unity Game Development Repository

---

## Introduction

Transitioning a Unity game development repository to a new organizational structure is a powerful move for long-term maintainability, team productivity, and project scalability. However, such a reorganization—like the one from https://github.com/Tiny-Walnut-Games/the-seed/tree/seed-development to https://github.com/Tiny-Walnut-Games/the-seed/tree/seed-reorganization—commonly leads to broken script and asset references, scattered or outdated documentation, and a decrease in overall developer ergonomics. For a repository to function agentically, supporting both human and automated contributors, it must be navigable, robust, and accompanied by clear, up-to-date docs and best practices.

This report presents an actionable, thorough, and step-by-step plan to guide an assistant (or agent) through the process of auditing, repairing, and optimizing the repository. The plan integrates the latest best practices in Unity project structure, modern Unity tooling, automated code analysis and refactoring, documentation workflows, and DevOps/CI/CD. The approach is pragmatic, favoring repeatable actions and automation where feasible to accommodate cognitive demand avoidance and ensure sustainable maintenance for the future. Throughout the report, relevant references are cited to maximize practical utility and adaptation for similar Unity projects.

---

## Overview of the Plan

The complete repo repair and optimization strategy consists of three major stages, each further divided into clear, actionable substeps:

1. **Repair Path and Script References**
  - Audit and fix broken C# script, asset, and GUID references.
  - Leverage automated tools to identify and resolve missing references.

2. **Reorganize and Update Documentation**
  - Audit and restructure documentation to match the new file/folder organization.
  - Rebuild API and usage docs with automatic and manual generation tools.

3. **General Cleanup and Developer Experience Enhancements**
  - Ensure project structure and source control hygiene.
  - Remove cruft, optimize .meta file handling, enforce code and doc style conventions.
  - Set up tooling and workflows to prevent future breakage.

Each stage is detailed with concrete recommendations, specific tools (including open-source and Unity Asset Store solutions), best practices, automation options, and maintenance tips.

---

## 1. Repair Path and Script References

### 1.1. Understanding Reference Breakage in Unity

**Unity asset and script references are maintained via unique GUIDs in .meta files, not by paths or filenames.** When assets are moved inside the Editor, Unity updates references smartly; outside edits or mishandling .meta files often result in broken references in Scenes, Prefabs, or other resources, leading to the infamous “The referenced script on this Behaviour is missing!” error. In a git-based workflow, not tracking .meta files or moving assets outside of Unity exacerbates these issues.

**Key principles:**
- Always move/rename assets within Unity Editor to preserve references and .meta integrity.
- Always commit .meta files to version control.
- Use automated tools to detect and fix missing references.

---

### 1.2. Audit Broken References

**Step 1: Run Automated Reference Checks**

Use editor tools that scan for missing and broken references project-wide:

- **Missing Reference Fixer** (Asset Store): Scans entire projects for missing scripts and references in Scenes, Prefabs, ScriptableObjects, etc., and provides reports with one-click cleanup.
- **Cleanup-Z** (GitHub): Offers utilities to clean missing references, list unapplied prefabs, and other project hygiene features directly in the Unity Editor.
- **Missing References Finder** (GitHub): Free, works with Unity’s Package Manager, and identifies missing references in Scenes, assets, or the whole project.
- **Missing References Hunter** (GitHub): Deep scanning for GUID mismatches across all asset files.

**Procedure:**
- Add one or more tools to the project (via Package Manager or custom asset import).
- Run the missing references scan, ensure the scope is set to “Entire Project.”
- Output reports (CSV, logs, UI summaries) for tracking progress and validating repairs.

**Tip:** For large projects, run these tools after hours or on a CI build server to avoid Editor slowdowns.

---

**Step 2: Manual Spot-Check Key Scenes and Prefabs**

Open critical scenes and prefabs in the Editor and manually inspect the Inspector pane for:
- Missing script components (“Script missing” warning).
- Null references in serialized fields.
- Issues with network managers, event systems, or assets inherited from third parties.

Use the “Ping” or “Locate” functions in reference fixer tools to quickly navigate to affected objects for manual review.

---

### 1.3. Repair Broken References

**Step 3: Automated Cleanup**

Use the “one-click fix” features in tools above to:
- Remove missing script components from GameObjects.
- Fix paths if the asset still exists under a new name/location but maintains the same GUID.
- Clean up dangling references.

**For GUID mismatches:**
- If an asset’s .meta file was overwritten or mismatched, use tools like [GUID Fixer & Meta File Modifier (Asset Store)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/guid-fixer-meta-file-modifier-230484) or [Unity GUID Regenerator](https://github.com/jeffjadulco/unity-guid-regenerator) to search and replace/correct GUIDs project-wide.
- If you have a backup or git commit from before the reorganization, compare the .meta files to retrieve lost GUIDs for reconnection.

**Note:** Run all such tools with the Editor closed, backup your repo, and commit frequently between repair steps to avoid accidental data loss.

---

**Step 4: Manual Fix for Critical System References**

Occasionally, automated repair isn’t enough, especially for:
- Custom asset loaders, resource paths in scripts, or hardcoded string-based paths.
- Custom serialization or JSON/YAML config files referring to old asset paths.

**Approach:**
- Use VSCode, Rider, or a tool like PowerGREP to search your codebase for path strings that likely reference assets (e.g., “Assets/OldPath/”, “Resources.Foo”, etc.).
- Use bulk find-and-replace utilities in your IDE, or write scripts to update such paths, leveraging .NET’s System.IO.Path to safely join and normalize paths.
- Verify each fix by running relevant gameplay and editor tests.

---

**Step 5: Bulk Path Updates in C# Scripts**

For C# scripts referencing assets via path strings, automate fixes:
- Write a C# tool/script that recursively parses all .cs files, finds path literals, and updates them to new values based on your new structure.
- Use `Path.Combine` for cross-platform path safety.
- Validate by running Unity project build and relevant editor-time tests.

**For serialized asset GUIDs in .asset, .prefab, and .unity files:**
- Write or use existing tools (e.g., `AssetDatabase.FindAssets`) to rewire references as needed.

---

**Step 6: Validate by Rebuilding**

- Delete the `Library/` folder (to force asset re-import), then reopen Unity, allowing it to rebuild the asset database.
- Open all major scenes and prefabs, running “Play Mode” where feasible to check for runtime errors.
- Address any remaining missing reference warnings.

---

**Best Practices for Future Maintenance**

- **Always move/rename assets within the Unity Editor, not in the file system, to preserve GUIDs and references.**
- **Never commit or revert changes without the .meta files included.**
- **Enable and enforce “Visible Meta Files” in Unity Editor settings for all developers.**
- **Adopt Unity’s own backup and version control best practices, including frequent, small commits and descriptive commit messages.**
- **For large-scale changes, always use feature branches, and merge to main only after full validation.**

---

## 2. Reorganize and Update Documentation

A robust documentation system is vital for developer effectiveness, on-boarding, and facilitating automated operations. Below is a practical approach to cleaning up and sustaining documentation through changes.

### 2.1. Audit and Inventory Existing Documentation

**Step 1: List all Documentation Points**

- Locate README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and other top-level docs.
- Examine sub-directory docs (e.g., `/Docs`, `Assets/Documentation`, `/doc`, `/wiki/`).
- Identify comments and XML summaries in C# code, plus any auto-generated API docs.
- List anything duplicated, obsolete, or referencing old file paths.

**Step 2: Map Documentation Coverage vs. New Structure**

- Cross-reference new folders/files with documentation.
- Note outdated folder mentions.
- Spot missing documentation for new scripts, assets, or systems.

---

### 2.2. Restructure Documentation to Match New Layout

**Step 3: Define Documentation Hierarchy**

- Align documentation file and folder structure with the project’s new assets/scripts/scenes layout.
- Place an updated `README.md` at the repository root, with overview, getting-started, and navigation sections.
- Create sub-docs for major folders or features: “Scripting Guide,” “Asset Workflow,” “Scene Setup,” “Subsystems,” etc.

**Sample Structure:**

| Doc File/Folder              | Purpose                                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| README.md                    | Project overview, quickstart, navigation, main links |
| /Docs/GettingStarted.md      | Setup and running the project                        |
| /Docs/Architecture.md        | High-level system breakdown                          |
| /Docs/Scripting/API.md       | API Reference/how-to                                 |
| /Docs/Contributing.md        | Style guides, branching/PR workflow                  |
| /Docs/CHANGELOG.md           | Release notes and recent changes                     |

---

**Step 4: Update All Path and Reference Mentions**

- Use find-and-replace tools to swap old folder names/references for new ones throughout all documentation.
- Review and rewrite example code snippets that use now-moved files (e.g., import paths, scenes, prefabs).
- For large docs, script this step if possible.

---

### 2.3. Automate API and Code Documentation Generation

**Step 5: Adopt an API Documentation Generator (DocFX or Similar)**

- **DocFX** is the de facto tool for C# API documentation and easily integrates with Unity. Configure `docfx.json`, run against your `/Assets/Scripts` and auto-generate API docs from C# XML comments.
  - Open-source DocFX Unity setups exist: [Stahovl/DocfxUnityExample](https://github.com/Stahovl/DocfxUnityExample), [NormandErwan/DocFxForUnity](https://github.com/NormandErwan/DocFxForUnity).
- Configure automatic GitHub Actions/CI jobs to regenerate API docs on each push, publishing to `/docs` or GitHub Pages.
- Place “how to generate/update docs” instructions in `/Docs/README.md` for human and AI contributors.

---

**Step 6: Improve Inline Comments and Code Summaries**

- Adopt a consistent standard (e.g., triple-slash `/// XML` comments for public APIs, Unity [Tooltip]/[Header] for serialized fields).
- Use editor extensions or static analysis tools (Rider, VSCode, Qodana) to enforce style and spot undocumented code sections.
- Run `docfx` or similar tools locally to visually check API doc completeness and link correctness.

---

**Step 7: Create/Update Contribution Docs and Style Guides**

- Make sure `CONTRIBUTING.md` and any style guides reference the *current* folder structure, not outdated locations.
- List conventions for scene naming, asset naming, commit messages, code style, and documentation.
- Link to external or company-adopted Unity style guides (see [SamuelAsherRivello/unity-project-template](https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/unity-project-template), [justinwasilenko/Unity-Style-Guide](https://github.com/justinwasilenko/Unity-Style-Guide), [themorfeus/unity_project_structure](https://github.com/themorfeus/unity_project_structure)).

---

**Step 8: Automate Doc Validation and Linting**

- Add documentation validation to your CI jobs (e.g., failing builds if doc coverage falls below threshold).
- Use linters to enforce Markdown/Docs style and flag broken links.
- Combine documentation generation and static analysis as part of a “quality gate” before merges.

---

**Step 9: Prune Outdated or Redundant Documentation**

- Remove or archive documentation files no longer relevant to the current codebase.
- If valuable history is present (e.g., design docs), move to a `/legacy` folder or distinguish with clear deprecated banners.

---

## 3. General Repository Cleanup and Developer Experience Enhancements

The final and ongoing phase is to ensure the repository remains streamlined, healthy, and a pleasure to develop in, both for humans and agentic assistants. This requires both one-off cleanup and systematic practices.

### 3.1. Ensure Repository Structure and Source Control Hygiene

**Step 1: Apply Best Practices for Unity Project Folder Structure**

- Adopt one of Unity’s recommended folder structures:

Example (recommended for medium/large projects):

```
Assets/
  _ProjectName/
    Art/
      Materials/
      Models/
      Textures/
    Audio/
      Music/
      SFX/
    Code/
      Scripts/    # All gameplay and feature C# scripts
      Editor/     # Custom Editor scripts
      Shaders/
    Prefabs/
    Scenes/
    UI/
    ThirdParty/
    Plugins/
    Resources/
    Tests/
ProjectSettings/
Packages/
Docs/
```

- Keep third-party or plugin assets in their own top-level folder to isolate from custom project assets.
- Avoid empty folders; if required for source control, place a `.keep` file.
- Avoid spaces, special characters, or non-ASCII in folder/file names.

**Step 2: Update/Review .gitignore**

- Make sure `.gitignore` excludes auto-generated/binary files and tracks only essential source files. **Typical Unity .gitignore:**

```
/Library/
/Temp/
/Obj/
/Build/
/Builds/
/Logs/
/UserSettings/
/MemoryCaptures/
*.csproj
*.unityproj
*.sln
*.suo
*.tmp
*.user
*.userprefs
*.pidb
*.booproj
*.svd
*.pdb
*.mdb
*.opendb
*.VC.db
sysinfo.txt
*.apk
*.aab
*.unitypackage
```
- Ensure `Assets`, `ProjectSettings`, `Packages`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and all `.meta` files are under version control.
- Use [GitHub’s Unity .gitignore template](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore) as reference.

---

### 3.2. Asset and Meta File Integrity

**Step 3: Enforce Meta File Tracking**

- Confirm every asset and folder has a corresponding `.meta` file.
- If missing, reimport the project in the Unity Editor and resolve any “new GUID” warnings.
- Never hand-edit, move, or rename `.meta` files; always use Unity Editor actions.

---

### 3.3. Automated and Manual Project Cleanup

**Step 4: Remove Unused Assets, Duplicates, and Empty Folders**

Utilize tools such as:
- **Asset Cleaner PRO** (Asset Store): Finds and removes unused files, marks unused assets in the Project window, and can perform cleaned deletions.
- **rCleaner** (Asset Store): Pro-grade cleaner with safe trashing/restore of assets, supports undo, and integrates with Unity’s asset database.
- **Unity Sweeper** (GitHub): Free tool for detecting and batch removing unused files in your project; creates a backup before deleting anything.

**Procedure:**
- Scan for unused assets and folders.
- Review the list before deletion—sometimes “unused” assets are loaded dynamically or as Resources.
- Move deleted files to an “archive” folder before final removal as a precaution.

---

**Step 5: Run Static Code Analysis and Linting**

- Add [Unity Project Auditor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.project-auditor@latest) for static code, project, asset, and performance analysis directly in the Editor.
- Use [JetBrains Qodana](https://blog.jetbrains.com/qodana/2024/01/net-code-quality-tools-qodana/) or PVS-Studio for CI/CD-integrated C# static analysis and ensure code quality standards are met.
- Add Unity’s [Test Framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html) and ensure tests are run via CI.

---

### 3.4. Enforce Code and Doc Style Standards

**Step 6: Set Up Coding Standards**

- Adopt and document code style: C# naming conventions, camelCase/private, PascalCase/public, etc..
- Use EditorConfig, IDE settings, or editor plugins to automate enforcing these conventions.

**Step 7: Naming and Asset Guidelines**

- Establish unified asset, prefab, material, and scene naming conventions (see [Unity Style Guide](https://github.com/justinwasilenko/Unity-Style-Guide) for reference).
- Add a style guide doc to `/Docs` or `/Contributing`.

---

### 3.5. Continuous Integration and Repo Automation

**Step 8: Set Up CI/CD for Quality Gates, Builds, and Maintenance**

- Configure GitHub Actions or a CI provider to run:
  - Linting and code quality checks (e.g., Qodana, Project Auditor).
  - Automated tests.
  - Documentation generation and deployment.
  - Unity Build Automation (for multiplatform builds and build/test on every commit).
  - Git repository maintenance (`git maintenance run`) as part of scheduled jobs for opt-in performance and reliability.
- Use “protected branches” and require all CI checks to pass before merging.

**Step 9: Automate Maintenance (Optional/Advanced)**

- Consider agentic automation for pull requests: modern assistants like GitHub Copilot coding agent can be assigned QC/maintenance tasks (updating workflows, refactoring docs, fixing warnings), iteratively improving the repository.
- Leverage bots for standardized repository hygiene, such as Google’s [repo-automation-bots](https://github.com/googleapis/repo-automation-bots) for label sync, dependency alerts, and linting across many repos.
