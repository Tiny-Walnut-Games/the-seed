# üêæ PET Charter: Badge Pet System Governance

> üìú *"Refactoring is not a sign of failure; it's a sign of growth. Like molting, but for code."* ‚Äî **Code Evolution Theory, Vol. III**

## Executive Summary

The **PET (Pet Evolution & Transparency) Charter** establishes governance, privacy, and fairness principles for the TLDA Badge Pet System, ensuring contributor growth is tracked transparently, fairly, and with full accountability.

## üìä What We Track

### ‚úÖ Tracked Data
- **TLDL Entries**: Validated contributions to The Living Dev Log
- **XP Points**: Experience points from documented contributions
- **Collaboration Events**: Cross-contributor interactions and pair programming
- **Rationale Quality**: Quality scoring of technical decisions and documentation
- **Pet Evolution State**: Current pet archetype, level, and abilities
- **Pet History**: Append-only evolution ledger with timestamps
- **Event Ledger**: Cryptographically hashed, immutable activity log

### ‚ùå Not Tracked
- **Private Branches**: Personal development work not shared publicly
- **Personal Commit Messages**: Private repository commit histories
- **Off-Repository Activity**: External projects or private communications
- **PII Beyond Handle**: No personal information beyond GitHub usernames
- **Browsing Patterns**: No tracking of documentation reading habits
- **Time Spent**: No surveillance of development session durations

## üßÆ Scoring & Evolution

### Public Formulas
All scoring algorithms are publicly documented in `docs/registry/` with:
- **Deterministic Evolution**: Pet progression calculated from event ledger
- **Open Source Algorithms**: All scoring logic available for audit
- **Reproducible Results**: Same input always produces same output
- **Version Controlled**: Formula changes tracked with migration paths

### Pet Evolution Mechanics
- **XP Thresholds**: Clear level requirements for each archetype
- **Collaborative Bonuses**: Enhanced progression through teamwork
- **Quality Multipliers**: Better documentation yields faster growth
- **Diversity Rewards**: Cross-genre contributions unlock special abilities

## ‚öñÔ∏è Appeal & Opt-Out Rights

### Recalculation Requests
Contributors may request score recalculation via:
- **TLDL Entry**: Documented rationale for review request
- **GitHub Issue**: Formal appeal with evidence and reasoning
- **Instant Processing**: Appeals processed within 48 hours
- **Transparent Review**: All appeals and resolutions publicly documented

### Complete Opt-Out
- **Instant Opt-Out**: Disable all pet/persona features immediately
- **No Penalty**: Opt-out carries no reputation or access penalties
- **No Shaming**: Opt-out status is private and not broadcasted
- **Reversible**: Contributors may re-enable features at any time

## üõ°Ô∏è Fairness & Abuse Mitigation

### Anti-Gaming Measures
- **Diminishing Returns**: Excessive activity yields reduced XP gains
- **Integrity Gating**: Quality checks prevent low-effort contributions
- **Collaboration Diversity**: Requires interaction with multiple contributors
- **Random Audits**: Periodic manual review of top performers
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents contribution flooding and spam

### Equality Principles
- **No Public Leaderboards**: Rankings are private to prevent competition toxicity
- **No Paid Boosts**: Monetary contributions do not affect pet progression
- **NFT Opt-In Only**: Blockchain features require explicit consent
- **Skill-Based Progression**: Advancement based on contribution quality, not quantity

## üîç Transparency & Accountability

### Open Audit Trail
- **Public Ledgers**: All pet evolution events are publicly auditable
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: HMAC-SHA256 signatures prevent data tampering
- **Version History**: Complete change history for all pet states
- **Algorithm Transparency**: Open source formulas with public documentation

### Privacy Protection
- **Pseudonymous Tracking**: Only GitHub handles used for identification
- **Minimal Data**: Only contribution-relevant information stored
- **Right to Erasure**: Complete data deletion available on request
- **Secure Storage**: Cryptographic protection for all stored data

## üìã Implementation Standards

### Data Retention
- **Active Contributions**: Indefinite retention for public contributions
- **Inactive Accounts**: Automatic archival after 12 months of inactivity
- **Deletion Requests**: Complete removal within 30 days of request
- **Backup Policies**: Encrypted backups with same privacy standards

### Security Standards
- **Environment Variables**: Cryptographic keys stored securely
- **Regular Audits**: Monthly security reviews and penetration testing
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for system administrators
- **Incident Response**: 24-hour notification for any data breaches

## üéØ Enforcement & Governance

### Charter Violations
- **Community Review**: Violations reviewed by contributor community
- **Graduated Responses**: Warnings, temporary restrictions, then permanent removal
- **Appeal Process**: Right to challenge enforcement decisions
- **Transparency**: All enforcement actions documented publicly

### Charter Evolution
- **Community Proposals**: Charter changes require public RFC process
- **Consensus Building**: Major changes require 75% community approval
- **Migration Support**: Automated tools for adapting to charter updates
- **Backward Compatibility**: New versions maintain compatibility when possible
