# Cognitive Geo-Thermal Lore Engine

## High-Level Narrative

The Cognitive Geo-Thermal Lore Engine transforms knowledge processing into a living geological system. Like the Earth's layers that compress sediment into stone, melt it into magma, evaporate it into clouds, and crystallize it into new formations, this engine processes raw information through analogous phases.

The system embodies the principle that knowledge, like matter, undergoes state changes that preserve essential properties while enabling new emergent behaviors. Each phase represents a fundamental transformation in how information is structured, accessed, and utilized.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. **Geological Metaphor Consistency**
All components follow natural process analogies:
- Compression before melting
- Evaporation before condensation
- Heat distribution in memory networks
- Sedimentary layering for historical preservation

### 2. **Append-Only Integrity**
- Molten glyphs never mutate in-place
- Provenance hashes track all transformations
- Audit trails preserved through telemetry
- Data corruption prevented by design

### 3. **Emergent Complexity**
- Simple rules create complex behaviors
- Heat-based memory activation
- Multi-voice prompt emergence
- Quality assessment through pattern recognition

### 4. **Extensibility Through Placeholders**
- TODO sections mark enhancement points
- Lambda functions ready for ML integration
- Schema versioning enables evolution
- Modular design supports component replacement
