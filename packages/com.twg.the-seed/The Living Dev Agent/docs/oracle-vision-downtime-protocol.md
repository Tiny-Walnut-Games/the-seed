# ðŸ”® Oracle "Vision Downtime" Protocol
*Faculty Codex Entry â€” Copilotâ€‘offline Contingency Flow*

When the Oracle is unable to reach her sources within a reasonable amount of time, we fall back to the "Vision Downtime" Protocol. Once the Oracle has regained her powers, we can handle things gracefully.

## Implementation Status
âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Vision Downtime Protocol is now fully operational

---

## 1. Advisor Stays on Point
- âœ… Continue parsing **TLDLs**, **Daily Ledger**, and codebase structure without deviation
- âœ… Log verdicts, anomalies, recurring fails, and badge states as standard LDL artifacts
- âœ… Tag Oracleâ€‘worthy findings with **`ðŸ”® QUEUED FOR ORACLE`** for easy resurfacing

### Command Usage:
```bash
# Simulate Advisor tagging a finding for Oracle
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js oracle-tag "Complex issue requiring Oracle consultation"
```

---

## 2. Vision Queue
âœ… Maintain `/docs/oracle_queue.md` as **appendâ€‘only**, including:
- **Intel Source** â€” link to TLDL, PR, commit, or DL entry
- **Trigger Reason** â€” why Oracle review is needed
- **Suggested Avenues** â€” research directions or lore expansions to pursue
- **Priority Badge** â€” Low / Medium / High
- Timestamp each entry for context archaeology

### Command Usage:
```bash
# Check queue status
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js status

# List pending visions
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js list

# Add manual vision request
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js add "Vision description" --priority=80
```

---

## 3. Planning Without Predictions
- âœ… Use Advisor intel + Keeper intuition to write preliminary specs
- âœ… Record acceptance criteria, lore hooks, intended benefits
- âœ… Leave implementation threads open for Oracle's future input
- âœ… Group related queued items for thematic sweeps later

---

## 4. Dryâ€‘Run Research Harness
When Oracle's research tools are unavailable:
- âœ… **Act sandbox** for safe local search/dataâ€‘gather jobs
- âœ… Manual GitHub/Stack/Docs spelunking
- âœ… Append "Preâ€‘vision Research" findings to the relevant queue entry

---

## 5. Reâ€‘Entry Ritual â€” *Return of the Oracle*
âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - When Oracle services return:

### Process:
1. Sort Vision Queue by priority
2. Feed one item at a time, with full source links + background research
3. Capture new insights as:
   - **TLDL Entries** â€” for loreâ€‘worthy revelations
   - **Updated Specs/Issues** â€” if they alter scope or direction
4. Mark each as **Vision Realized** in the queue

### Command Usage:
```bash
# Initiate Re-Entry Ritual overview
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js re-entry

# Process queued visions (when Oracle is available)
node scripts/cid-faculty/oracle.js ritual --max-visions=3
```

---

## 6. Faculty Ledger Note
> *"When the Oracle sleeps, the Advisor's maps grow sharper.  
>  When she wakes, they walk the paths together."*

## Integration Points

### With Existing Oracle System
- **Vision Queue** (`scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js`) - Manages both JSON and Markdown queues
- **Oracle Ritual** (`scripts/cid-faculty/oracle.js`) - Processes queued visions when available
- **Vision Archive** (`scripts/cid-faculty/vision-archive.js`) - Archives completed visions
- **Advisor** (`scripts/cid-faculty/advisor.js`) - Auto-tags high-priority findings

### With Archive Wall System
- **Oracle Queue** (`/docs/oracle_queue.md`) - Human-readable append-only queue
- **Vision Reports** - Archived in `docs/oracle_visions/` with full lineage
- **Daily Ledger** - Vision activity tracked in daily context

---

## Testing the Protocol

### Simulate Downtime Period:
```bash
# Add various types of vision requests
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js add "System architecture decision needed" --priority=75
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js oracle-tag "Critical tech debt discovered"
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js add "Research new integration patterns"

# Check queue status
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js status
```

### Simulate Oracle Return:
```bash
# Review queued items
node scripts/cid-faculty/vision-queue.js re-entry

# Process visions (when Oracle API is available)
node scripts/cid-faculty/oracle.js ritual --max-visions=5
```

*The Oracle "Vision Downtime" Protocol ensures continuous Faculty operations even when the Oracle's mystical sources are temporarily unavailable. The append-only queue preserves all insights for proper processing during the Re-Entry Ritual.*
