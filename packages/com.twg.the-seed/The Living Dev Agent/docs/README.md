# 📚 Living Dev Agent Documentation

Welcome to the knowledge repository of the Living Dev Agent! This directory contains the sacred texts, templates, and living documentation that guide developers through their coding adventures.

## 🧙‍♂️ Documentation Lore

This directory serves as the **wisdom library** where development knowledge is preserved, shared, and evolved. Each document is crafted to be both technically precise and engaging, treating documentation as an integral part of the development adventure.

## 🎯 Documentation Structure

### 📜 TLDL (The Living Dev Log) System
The heart of our knowledge preservation system - where development stories become institutional wisdom.

#### TLDL Architecture (Post-Cutover)
- **[TLDL/entries/](../TLDL/entries/)**: All time-stamped development narratives and log entries ✅
- **[index.md](index.md)**: Chronicle Keeper's domain with complete entry index
- **[Monthly Archives](TLDL-Monthly/)**: Consolidated monthly reports with actionables and themes
- **[TLDL-Archive/](TLDL-Archive/)**: Historical archived entries for reference
- **Validation system**: Automated quality assurance for log entry integrity

#### TLDL Philosophy
- **Single source of truth**: All TLDL entries live in `TLDL/entries/` directory
- **Time-bound narratives**: Development adventures with specific dates and context
- **Future developers are the primary audience** 
- **Context is as important as the code itself**

#### TLDL Monthly Archives
- **[August 2025](TLDL-Monthly/2025-08.md)**: Latest consolidated archive
- **[Archive Directory](TLDL-Monthly/)**: All monthly reports and navigation

### 🎮 DevTimeTravel Integration
- **`devtimetravel_snapshot.yaml`**: Configuration for context capture
- **Temporal continuity**: Links between TLDL entries and development snapshots
- **Decision preservation**: Why choices were made, not just what was implemented

### 🛠️ Setup and Configuration Guides
- **`Copilot-Setup.md`**: Detailed guide for GitHub Copilot integration
- **Template documentation**: Instructions for using and extending the system
- **Best practices**: Evolved wisdom from development adventures

### 🏛️ Lore Documentation
Sacred texts that preserve the deeper knowledge and philosophy of the Living Dev Agent:
- **[lore/ritual_updates.md](lore/ritual_updates.md)**: RitualBot automated update system documentation
- **Future lore entries**: Expansion space for institutional knowledge and wisdom

## 🧰 TLDL Workflow Excellence

### Creating TLDL Entries

#### 🚀 Automated Creation (Preferred)
```bash
# Using the initialization script
scripts/init_agent_context.sh --create-tldl "FeatureName"

# Creates: TLDL/entries/TLDL-YYYY-MM-DD-FeatureName.md
# Timing: ~180ms execution
# Includes: Pre-filled template with metadata
```

#### 📝 Manual Creation
```bash
# Copy from template
cp docs/tldl_template.yaml TLDL/entries/TLDL-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-Title.md

# Edit with your preferred text editor
# Follow the established yaml front-matter structure
```

### TLDL Entry Quality Standards

#### 🏆 Sacred Text Criteria
- **Scroll-worthy content**: Valuable to developers months or years later
- **Adventure narrative**: Engaging story of development challenges and solutions
- **Technical precision**: Accurate, actionable information
- **Context richness**: Background, decisions, alternatives, outcomes

#### 📋 Entry Structure Template
```yaml
---
title: "Descriptive Adventure Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: "Developer Name"
type: "feature|bugfix|refactor|discovery|manifest"
status: "in-progress|completed|archived"
tags: ["relevant", "categorization", "tags"]
related_files: ["path/to/file1", "path/to/file2"]
epic: "Optional larger feature grouping"

### 🔍 TLDL Validation System

#### Automated Validation
```bash
# Standard validation (the daily ritual)
python3 src/SymbolicLinter/validate_docs.py --tldl-path docs/

# Execution Profile:
# - Timing: ~60ms (lightning fast feedback)
# - Tolerance: Warnings about entry ID format are acceptable
# - Purpose: Ensure TLDL entries follow established patterns
```

#### Expected Validation Results
- **PASS status**: Most entries should validate successfully
- **Warning tolerance**: Entry ID format warnings are normal
- **Error handling**: Clear guidance for resolution when issues arise

## 🧾 Sacred Documentation Maintenance

### Quality Assurance Rituals
```bash
# The complete documentation validation sequence
python3 src/SymbolicLinter/validate_docs.py --tldl-path docs/
python3 src/SymbolicLinter/symbolic_linter.py --path docs/
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" docs/ # Hunt for documentation debt
```

### Content Guidelines
- **Write for your future self**: Assume you'll forget context in 6 months
- **Include examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Link liberally**: Connect related concepts and resources
- **Update gracefully**: Preserve historical context when making changes
