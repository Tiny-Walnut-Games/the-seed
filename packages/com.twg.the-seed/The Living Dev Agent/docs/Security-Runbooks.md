# 🚨 Security Runbooks and Emergency Procedures

## Emergency Response Playbook

### 🛑 Emergency Stop Procedures

#### Immediate Security Incident Response
1. **Disable Workflows** (Critical - 2 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Disable all workflows via Settings > Actions > Disable workflow
   # Or via GitHub CLI
   gh workflow disable --repo jmeyer1980/living-dev-agent security.yml
   gh workflow disable --repo jmeyer1980/living-dev-agent ci.yml
   ```

2. **Revoke Compromised Tokens** (Critical - 5 minutes)
   - Go to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Revoke all tokens immediately
   - Review audit logs for unauthorized access

3. **Isolate Repository** (High Priority - 10 minutes)
   - Make repository private temporarily
   - Remove external collaborators if suspicious activity detected
   - Disable GitHub Pages if enabled

#### Security Alert Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Response Time | Assignee | Actions |
|----------|---------------|----------|---------|
| 🚨 **Critical** | 2 hours | @jmeyer1980 | Emergency stop, immediate investigation |
| 🔥 **High** | 8 hours | @jmeyer1980 | Security review, patch deployment |
| ⚠️ **Medium** | 24 hours | @jmeyer1980 | Risk assessment, scheduled fix |
| 📝 **Low** | 72 hours | @jmeyer1980 | Documentation update, next release |

## Security Scan Result Interpretation

### 🛡️ Understanding Guarded Pass vs Fail

#### ✅ Guarded Pass Conditions
A security scan passes with "guarded pass" status when:
- **Minor vulnerabilities** detected but within acceptable risk threshold
- **False positives** identified and documented in security exceptions
- **Development-only dependencies** with known issues not affecting production
- **Legacy code patterns** with documented mitigation strategies

#### ❌ Security Fail Conditions
A security scan fails when:
- **High/Critical vulnerabilities** in production dependencies
- **Secrets or API keys** detected in code or git history
- **Security-sensitive files** with overly permissive access
- **Code patterns** with exploitable security flaws

#### 🔍 Result Interpretation Guide

**Dependency Scan Results:**
```yaml
# Example safety report interpretation
vulnerabilities_found: 2
severity_breakdown:
  high: 0        # ❌ FAIL if > 0
  medium: 1      # ⚠️ REVIEW if > 3
  low: 1         # ✅ ACCEPTABLE if < 10

action_required:
  - Review medium severity vulnerabilities
  - Plan update strategy for affected packages
  - Document risk acceptance if update not feasible
```

**Secret Scan Results:**
```yaml
# TruffleHog interpretation
secrets_detected: 1
verification_status:
  verified: 0    # ❌ FAIL if > 0 - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
  unverified: 1  # ⚠️ REVIEW - likely false positive but investigate

action_required:
  - Rotate any verified secrets immediately
  - Add unverified patterns to .trufflehogignore if confirmed false positive
```

**CodeQL Analysis:**
```yaml
# CodeQL SARIF interpretation
alerts:
  error: 0       # ❌ FAIL if > 0
  warning: 2     # ⚠️ REVIEW if > 5
  note: 5        # ✅ ACCEPTABLE if < 20

action_required:
  - Address all error-level findings immediately
  - Review warning-level findings for business impact
  - Document note-level findings for future improvement
```
