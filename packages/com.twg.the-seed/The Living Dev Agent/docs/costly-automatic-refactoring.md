# üìú Costly Automatic Doc Refactoring System

> üìú *"Every refactor is a gamble: clarity gained, XP drained."* ‚Äî **Faculty Doctrine, Vol. VII**

## Overview

The Costly Automatic Doc Refactoring System introduces strategic depth to documentation maintenance by requiring **XP investment** for Copilot-assisted refactoring. This system balances automation with accountability, ensuring contributors remain engaged while preserving scroll clarity.

## üéÆ The Strategic XP Mechanic

### Core Philosophy
- **XP represents cognitive load, emotional bandwidth, and archive stamina**
- **Each refactoring operation costs XP** based on complexity and urgency
- **Strategic decisions**: Spend XP now for clarity, or save for future critical moments
- **Copilot as summoned entity**: Not passive assistant, but ritual-bound archivist

### Cost Structure
```python
REFACTORING_COSTS = {
    "minor_format_fix": 25,       # Missing punctuation, basic formatting
    "metadata_completion": 50,    # Missing Entry ID, Author, Context fields  
    "section_restructure": 75,    # Missing/wrong sections (Objective, Discovery, etc.)
    "content_enhancement": 100,   # Placeholder text replacement, detailed improvements
    "comprehensive_rewrite": 150, # Complete document restructuring with Faculty standards
    "emergency_faculty_summon": 200  # Manual Copilot invocation for complex issues
}
```

### Urgency Multipliers
- **Normal** (1.0x): Standard refactoring timeline
- **High** (1.5x): Elevated priority fixes
- **Emergency** (2.0x): Critical Faculty standards violations

## üß† Faculty Standards Validation

### Automatic Issue Detection
The Faculty Standards Validator analyzes documents for:

1. **Metadata Compliance**: Missing Entry ID, Author, Context, Summary
2. **Structural Requirements**: Required sections (Objective, Discovery, Actions Taken, Key Insights, Next Steps)
3. **Content Quality**: Placeholder text, formatting issues, Faculty conventions
4. **Strategic Cost Analysis**: Affordable/Stretch/Unaffordable categorization

### Example Analysis
```bash
# Analyze document for refactoring needs
./scripts/chronicle-keeper/refactor-docs analyze TLDL/entries/problematic-file.md Alice

üìä Analysis Results:
  Issues found: 14
  Total cost: 1937 XP
  Affordable: ‚ùå No
  Current XP: 185
  Strategic recommendation: Emergency Faculty standards violation
```

## üí∞ Strategic XP Management

### Cost Tiers
- **Affordable (‚â§25% XP)**: Excellent value, immediate clarity gains
- **Stretch (25-75% XP)**: Strategic timing considerations  
- **Unaffordable (‚â•75% XP)**: Evaluate critical importance first

### Refactoring Types
1. **Affordable Only**: Low-risk fixes within budget comfort zone
2. **Selective** (default): Affordable + moderate stretch fixes
3. **Comprehensive**: All affordable and stretch fixes if budget allows

## üîß Usage Examples

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Quick analysis
./scripts/chronicle-keeper/refactor-docs analyze file.md Developer

# Safe refactoring (affordable fixes only)
./scripts/chronicle-keeper/refactor-docs fix file.md Developer affordable

# Strategic refactoring (balanced approach)
./scripts/chronicle-keeper/refactor-docs fix file.md Developer selective

# Emergency refactoring (2x cost!)
./scripts/chronicle-keeper/refactor-docs emergency file.md Developer comprehensive

# Check affordability before committing
./scripts/chronicle-keeper/refactor-docs afford Developer 150
```

### Programmatic Interface
```python
from chronicle_keeper_refactoring import ChronicleKeeperRefactoring

# Initialize system
refactoring = ChronicleKeeperRefactoring()

# Analyze document
analysis = refactoring.analyze_document_for_auto_refactoring("file.md", "Developer")

# Execute strategic refactoring
result = refactoring.execute_auto_refactoring("file.md", "Developer", "selective", "normal")
```

## üèÜ Achievement System Integration

### Refactoring Achievements
- **üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Chronicler Summoner**: First Faculty standards refactoring
- **üí∏ XP Gambler**: High-stakes refactoring (‚â•200 XP spent)
- **üìú Refactoring Master**: Total 500+ XP invested in Faculty compliance

### CopilotCoin Rewards
- **Conversion Rate**: 10 XP = 1 CopilotCoin
- **Strategic Value**: Spending XP earns premium currency for advanced features

## üìä Real-World Example

**Before**: TLDL file with 14 validation errors
```
‚ùå Missing Entry ID metadata
‚ùå Missing required section 'Objective'
‚ùå Placeholder text: [What did you learn]
‚ùå Missing space after punctuation
... 10 more issues
Total Cost: 1937 XP
```

**Strategic Decision**:
```bash
Current XP: 185
Options:
‚úÖ 1 affordable fix (25 XP) - punctuation
‚ö†Ô∏è 1 stretch fix (112 XP) - missing section
üö® 12 unaffordable fixes (1800 XP) - need more XP
```

**Action Taken**:
```bash
./scripts/chronicle-keeper/refactor-docs fix file.md Alice affordable
# Result: Spent 25 XP, fixed 1 issue, 13 remain
# Strategic advice: Build more XP before tackling major issues
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Gaming Measures

### Diminishing Returns
- **Daily caps** prevent XP farming through excessive refactoring
- **Quality assessment** ensures meaningful improvements
- **Urgency validation** prevents emergency abuse

### Faculty Oversight
- **Randomized review** of high-cost refactoring operations
- **Quality metrics** track improvement effectiveness
- **Community feedback** on refactoring value

## üöÄ Integration with Chronicle Keeper

### Workflow Triggers
The system integrates with existing Chronicle Keeper patterns:

1. **üß† Brain Emoji Issues**: Auto-analyze for refactoring needs
2. **TLDL: Comments**: Check Faculty compliance before processing
3. **Merged PRs**: Post-merge refactoring recommendations
4. **Workflow Failures**: Emergency refactoring suggestions

### GitHub Workflow Integration
```yaml
- name: üìú Auto-Refactoring Analysis
  if: contains(github.event.issue.title, 'üß†üí∏')  # XP spending trigger
  run: |
    python3 scripts/chronicle-keeper/auto-refactoring.py \
      --analyze "docs/problematic-file.md" \
      --developer "${{ github.actor }}" \
      --output analysis.json
```

## üéØ The Bottom Line

**This XP-cost refactoring system transforms documentation maintenance from a chore into a strategic resource management game**:

1. **Every refactoring decision has weight** - XP investment creates meaningful choice
2. **Quality improvements require sacrifice** - cognitive load represented as XP cost  
3. **Strategic timing matters** - when to spend vs. save for critical moments
4. **Collaborative accountability** - team XP budgets encourage shared responsibility
5. **Gamified progression** - achievements and rewards for Faculty compliance

**Result**: Contributors actively engage with documentation quality while maintaining sustainable XP economies for long-term project health.
