## üìä Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow Integration

```python
# 1. Project analysis and planning
bridge = WarblerGemma3Bridge()
analysis = bridge.warbler_decision_assist(
    "Choose architecture for multiplayer game",
    ["Client-Server", "P2P", "Hybrid"]
)

# 2. Code review and optimization
script_content = read_unity_script("PlayerController.cs")
review = bridge.analyze_unity_script(script_content, "performance")

# 3. Documentation generation
tldl_entry = bridge.generate_tldl_entry(
    "Simplified Ollama integration implementation",
    ["Direct binary management", "Enhanced stubs", "Docker removal"]
)

# 4. Batch processing for multiple tasks
results = bridge.batch_process_prompts([
    {"prompt": "Optimize physics calculations", "context": "Unity Performance"},
    {"prompt": "Improve UI responsiveness", "context": "Unity UI"},
    {"prompt": "Enhance audio system", "context": "Unity Audio"}
])
```

### Unity Editor Integration

1. **Project Setup**
   - Use Warbler AI Project Orchestrator
   - Generate intelligent project structures
   - Create AI-optimized component templates

2. **Development Assistance**
   - Real-time code analysis
   - Architecture recommendations
   - Performance optimization suggestions

3. **Documentation**
   - Automated TLDL entry generation
   - Development milestone tracking
   - Technical decision documentation

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Failed to download Ollama"
- **Cause**: Network connectivity or GitHub rate limiting
- **Solution**: Check internet connection, try again later
- **Fallback**: Enhanced stubs still provide value

#### "Ollama binary not available"
- **Cause**: Download failed or permission issues
- **Solution**: Check file permissions, run as administrator if needed
- **Fallback**: Enhanced stubs continue to work

#### "Model download failed"
- **Cause**: Insufficient disk space or network timeout
- **Solution**: Free up disk space, use smaller models
- **Fallback**: System suggests alternative models

#### "Server failed to start"
- **Cause**: Port already in use or permission issues
- **Solution**: Check port 11434 availability, restart system
- **Fallback**: Enhanced stubs provide immediate functionality

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check system status
python3 scripts/test_ollama_api.py

# Detailed OllamaManager diagnostics
python3 -c "
from scripts.ollama_manager import OllamaManager
import json
manager = OllamaManager()
print(json.dumps(manager.get_status(), indent=2))
"

# Bridge functionality test
python3 -c "
from scripts.warbler_gemma3_bridge import WarblerGemma3Bridge
bridge = WarblerGemma3Bridge()
print(json.dumps(bridge.get_system_status(), indent=2))
"
```
