# TLDL Archive

This directory contains archived TLDL source files that have been consolidated into monthly reports.

## Purpose

After monthly TLDL archives are generated, the source TLDL files are moved here to:
- Maintain clean organization in active documentation directories
- Preserve historical source files for reference
- Provide traceability back to original entries

## Structure

Files are archived with their original names:
- `TLDL-YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md` - Original TLDL entries
- Organized by archival date, not source date
- Cross-referenced in monthly archive reports

## Navigation

- **Monthly Archives**: [../TLDL-Monthly/](../TLDL-Monthly/) - Consolidated monthly reports
- **Active TLDL**: [../](../) and [../../TLDL/entries/](../../TLDL/entries/) - Current TLDL locations
- **TLDL Index**: [../index.md](../index.md) - Chronicle Keeper index

## Retention Policy

Archived files are retained permanently for historical reference and traceability purposes.
