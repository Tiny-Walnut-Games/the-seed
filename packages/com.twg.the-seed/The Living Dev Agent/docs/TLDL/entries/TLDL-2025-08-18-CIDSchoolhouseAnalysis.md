## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- CID Schoolhouse successfully analyzed repository structure and patterns
- Automated context learning provided comprehensive project overview
- Integration with Chronicle Keeper TLDL system preserved analysis lineage

### What Could Be Improved
- Analysis scope could be expanded with issue-specific constraints
- Proposal prioritization could include team capacity considerations
- Badge system could reflect more nuanced project characteristics

### Knowledge Gaps Identified
- Primary improvement categories: documentation
- Long-term maintenance strategies for sustained repository health

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
- [ ] Workflow Security Hardening: Pin action versions and add security scanning to existing workflows
- [ ] Dependency Security Scanning: Add dependabot and security workflow for dependency updates
- [ ] Development Environment Scripts: Create setup and run scripts for faster developer onboarding

### Medium-term Actions (Medium Priority)

### Long-term Considerations (Low Priority)
- [ ] Schedule regular CID Schoolhouse analysis sessions
- [ ] Track proposal implementation and measure impact
- [ ] Expand analysis scope based on project evolution
