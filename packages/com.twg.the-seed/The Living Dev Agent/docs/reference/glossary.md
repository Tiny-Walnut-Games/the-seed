## 🏰 Core Concepts: The Foundation

### 🎯 Living Dev Agent (TLDA)

**What it is:** A smart system that automatically documents your development work and turns coding into an adventure.

**Simple explanation:** Imagine having a really smart diary that watches you code and writes down everything important you do, but makes it fun like a video game.

**Example:** When you fix a bug, TLDA automatically creates a story about how you solved it, so you (and your teammates) can learn from it later.

**Deep dive:** [System Architecture Overview](../architecture/system-overview.md)

---

### 📜 TLDL (The Living Dev Log)

**What it is:** Your personal development diary that grows automatically as you work.

**Simple explanation:** Like a journal, but for coding. Every important thing you do gets written down with context, so you never forget how you solved problems.

**Format:**

```md
TLDL-YYYY-MM-DD-DescriptiveTitle.md
Example: TLDL-2024-01-15-FixedDatabaseConnection.md
```

**Why it matters:**

- 📚 Never lose important decisions
- 🎯 Help teammates understand your work
- 🧠 Learn from your past self
- 📈 Track your growth over time

**Deep dive:** [TLDL Guide](../TLDL_GUIDE.md)

---

### 🏰 Mind-Castle

**What it is:** A metaphor for how TLDA organizes all your development knowledge.

**Simple explanation:** Think of your project like a magical castle with different rooms for different types of work. Each room has special tools and stores different kinds of knowledge.

**The rooms:**

- 🚪 **Entry Gates:** How you interact with the system (Unity, command line, web)
- 🧠 **Cognitive Core:** Where your work gets processed and understood
- 📚 **Knowledge Library:** Where all your documentation lives
- 🛡️ **Guardian Tower:** Quality checking and security
- ✨ **Intelligence Spire:** AI helpers and smart features

**Deep dive:** [Mind-Castle Visual Guide](../onboarding/visual-guide.md)

---

### 🎮 Adventure-Driven Development

**What it is:** Making coding feel like playing an RPG game with quests, achievements, and progress tracking.

**Simple explanation:** Instead of boring tasks, you go on "quests" to build features, earn "XP" for good work, and unlock "achievements" for milestones.

**Benefits:**

- 🎯 Makes long projects feel manageable
- 🏆 Celebrates your progress
- 👥 Encourages team collaboration
- 📈 Tracks skill development

**Example:** "Quest: Implement User Login" → Complete tasks → Earn "Security Guardian Badge"

---

# Network timeouts are OK - core libraries usually pre-installed
# Try installing individually if needed
pip install PyYAML argparse
```

---

### 📝 TLDL Validation Errors

**Problem:** "Missing required metadata field"

```markdown
# Add this metadata section at the top:
## Metadata
- Entry ID: TLDL-YYYY-MM-DD-YourTitle

- Summary: One sentence summary
```

**Problem:** "Missing required section"

```markdown
# Ensure you have all required sections:
## Objective
## Discovery (or Actions Taken)
## Key Insights
## Next Steps
```

---

### 🔧 Permission Issues

**Problem:** `Permission denied` when running scripts

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Or run with explicit interpreter
bash scripts/init_agent_context.sh
```

**Problem:** Can't write to directories

```bash
# Check if directories exist
mkdir -p .github/workflows TLDL/entries

# Check permissions
ls -la
```

---

### ⚡ Performance Issues

**Problem:** Validation taking too long
