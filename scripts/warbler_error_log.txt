DEBUG INFO:
- User Request: Create a Zork-like randomly generated Text-based adventure game powered by Warbler. The game should launch with Unity's 2D features, have buttons for standard movement controls, but a standard chat system for interacting with everything else. Well... except for known items and interactables... for instance, if we examine a room, search a room, anything that would make a character examine things... buttons would pop up for picking or interacting with these items. I think a standard UI inventory might be helpful... a minimap showing areas we've  explored using acsii characters. I think you get the idea. The theme can be anything the player  requests and you can prompt them for ideas. It's a choose your own adventure.
