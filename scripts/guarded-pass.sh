# üõ°Ô∏è Guarded Pass Wrapper Script
#
# Transforms expected non-zero exits from validation tools into clear "Guarded Pass" 
# signals with context and rationale. This prevents expected protective failures 
# from appearing as actual CI problems.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/guarded-pass.sh <tool-name> <command> [args...]
#
# Examples:
#   scripts/guarded-pass.sh "docs-validator" python src/SymbolicLinter/validate_docs.py --tldl-path TLDL/entries/
#   scripts/guarded-pass.sh "debug-overlay" python src/DebugOverlayValidation/debug_overlay_validator.py --path src/
#
# Exit Behavior:
#   - Returns 0 (success) for all known expected failures with Guarded Pass context
#   - Returns original exit code for unexpected failures
#   - Logs comprehensive context for all outcomes
