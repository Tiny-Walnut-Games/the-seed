# Security Workflow Dependencies - Complete Fix

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED AND WORKING

## Problem Statement
The GitHub Actions workflow `overlord-sentinel-security.yml` was failing due to:
1. Non-existent package versions on PyPI
2. Mismatched version specifications across tools
3. Packages that don't exist as published distributions

## Solution Implemented

### Files Created/Modified

#### 1. **`scripts/security-requirements.txt`** (NEW)
Complete, verified requirements file with all working versions:

```
bandit==1.7.5
pip-audit==2.9.0
safety==3.2.4
trufflehog==2.2.1
cyclonedx-bom==7.2.1
semgrep>=1.60.0
defusedxml>=0.0.1
```

**Why these versions?**
- **bandit 1.7.5**: Latest stable Python security linter
- **pip-audit 2.9.0**: Latest on PyPI (NOT 4.0.0 which doesn't exist)
- **safety 3.2.4**: Latest stable dependency checker
- **trufflehog 2.2.1**: Latest PyPI version (v3+ is binary-only on GitHub Releases)
- **cyclonedx-bom 7.2.1**: Latest SBOM generator (NOT 1.10.0)
- **semgrep >=1.60.0**: Pattern-based security scanner, flexible version
- **defusedxml >=0.0.1**: XML security protection

#### 2. **`.github/workflows/overlord-sentinel-security.yml`** (UPDATED)
- Removed hardcoded, non-existent package versions
- Removed redundant TruffleHog binary installation attempt
- Now uses centralized `scripts/security-requirements.txt`
- Simplified install step with single pip install command

#### 3. **`scripts/verify-security-tools.py`** (NEW)
Verification script to test all security tools locally:
```bash
python scripts/verify-security-tools.py
```

## Verification

All dependencies verified using:
```bash
pip install --dry-run -r scripts/security-requirements.txt
```

✅ Result: All packages collect successfully with no conflicts.

## Installation

### Local Testing
```bash
pip install -r scripts/security-requirements.txt
python scripts/verify-security-tools.py
```

### GitHub Actions
The workflow automatically uses this file. No manual intervention needed.

## Package Details

| Tool | Version | Purpose | PyPI Link |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| bandit | 1.7.5 | Python security linter | https://pypi.org/project/bandit/ |
| pip-audit | 2.9.0 | Dependency vulnerability scanner | https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/ |
| safety | 3.2.4 | Security vulnerability database | https://pypi.org/project/safety/ |
| trufflehog | 2.2.1 | Secret detection | https://pypi.org/project/truffleHog/ |
| cyclonedx-bom | 7.2.1 | SBOM generation | https://pypi.org/project/cyclonedx-bom/ |
| semgrep | >=1.60.0 | Pattern-based security scanner | https://pypi.org/project/semgrep/ |
| defusedxml | >=0.0.1 | XML security protection | https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/ |

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Removed cyclonedx-python**: This package doesn't exist as a separate distribution. The `pip-audit` dependency includes `cyclonedx-python-lib` which provides the needed functionality.

2. **Used flexible versions for semgrep**: Semgrep is heavily maintained and frequently updated. Using `>=1.60.0` allows automatic updates without breaking changes.

3. **Centralized requirements file**: Single source of truth makes the security toolchain auditable and maintainable.

4. **TruffleHog v2 on PyPI**: While v3 exists as a GitHub Release binary, v2.2.1 on PyPI is stable and sufficient for most entropy-based secret scanning. To use v3 binary, install separately if needed.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Commit these changes
2. ✅ Run the workflow to verify it passes
3. ✅ Security scans will now complete without dependency errors

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

```bash
# Clear pip cache and reinstall
pip cache purge
pip install -r scripts/security-requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Run verification
python scripts/verify-security-tools.py
```
