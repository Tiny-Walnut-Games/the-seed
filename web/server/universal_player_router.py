Universal Player Router: Cross-Realm Player Management

Manages player state, transitions between realms, and persistent inventory/reputation
across multiverse simulations.

Features:
- Universal player IDs (global UUID)
- Active realm tracking (which game world player is in)
- Cross-realm inventory and reputation
- Realm transition mechanics (portals/travel)
- Narrative state persistence (affects story generation)
- Event emission for player transitions (feeds into Warbler context)

Example:
    router = UniversalPlayerRouter()
    
    # Create player
    player = router.create_player("alice", "human", starting_realm="sol_1")
    
    # Player travels to different realm
    router.transition_player("player_uuid_1", "sol_1", "sol_2")
    
    # Query player state for Warbler context
    context = router.get_warbler_context("player_uuid_1")
