"""
City Simulation Integration: NPCs as First-Class Multiverse Citizens

Integrates city simulations with MultiGameTickEngine so NPCs:
- Participate in control-ticks alongside game worlds
- Are aware of cross-realm events
- Remember player interactions across realms
- Generate dynamic dialogue based on multiverse state
- Trigger quests and narrative events

Architecture:
- Each city simulation registers with orchestrator
- NPCs synchronize during control-ticks
- Player transitions trigger NPC awareness events
- Warbler runs per control-tick to update NPC state

Example:
    integration = CitySimulationIntegration(orchestrator, player_router, warbler_bridge)
    
    # Register city simulation
    city_sim = CitySimulation(realm_id="sol_1", num_npcs=50)
    integration.register_city_simulation("sol_1", city_sim)
    
    # NPCs now participate in orchestrator ticks
    # When player travels, NPCs in destination get notified
    # When cross-game events propagate, NPCs react
