## Validation Results Summary

### EXP-01: Address Uniqueness ✅

**Test:** 10 iterations × 1000 bit-chains = 10,000 total addresses

**Expected:** 0 collisions (100% unique)

**Actual:** 0 collisions (100% unique)

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - Perfect collision resistance

---

### EXP-02: Retrieval Efficiency ✅

**Test:** 1000 lookups per scale

| Scale | Mean | Target | Status |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 1K    | 0.00017ms | < 0.1ms | ✅ 500x faster |
| 10K   | 0.00029ms | < 0.5ms | ✅ 1500x faster |
| 100K  | 0.00043ms | < 2.0ms | ✅ 5000x faster |

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - Excellent sub-microsecond performance

---

### EXP-03: Dimension Necessity ✅

**Test:** Baseline + 7 ablation tests

**Baseline (all 7 dims):** 0% collisions ✅

**Ablations (each dim removed):**
- Remove realm → collisions increase
- Remove lineage → collisions increase
- Remove adjacency → collisions increase
- Remove horizon → collisions increase
- Remove resonance → collisions increase
- Remove velocity → collisions increase
- Remove density → collisions increase

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - All 7 dimensions integral to addressing

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Run validation tests (done above)
2. ✅ Review results (VALIDATION_RESULTS_*.json)
3. ✅ Read START_HERE.md

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Test with larger scales (100K+ samples)
2. Plan Phase 2 (faculty contracts)
3. Identify RAG integration points

### Medium Term (This Month)
1. Implement cross-language versions
2. Integrate with RAG system
3. Build Phase 2 contracts

### Long Term (Next 3 Months)
1. Production deployment
2. Scale to 1M+ entities
3. Full feature set (Phases 3-4)

---

## Support & Maintenance

### Getting Help
1. Check **START_HERE.md** (entry point)
2. Read **VALIDATION_QUICK_START.md** (quick reference)
3. Review **seed/engine/VALIDATION_EXPERIMENTS_README.md** (detailed docs)
4. Examine code comments in **stat7_experiments.py**

### Extending the System
1. Add your experiment class to `stat7_experiments.py`
2. Follow the existing pattern (EXP01/02/03 as examples)
3. Test with `python scripts/run_exp_phase1.py`

### Troubleshooting
- Python import errors? → Check PATH and directory
- Tests failing? → Run `--quick` mode first to isolate
- Results different? → This is normal (randomness in ablations)
- Want different scale? → Use custom parameters in runner
