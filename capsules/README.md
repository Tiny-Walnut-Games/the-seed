> *"Refactoring is not a sign of failure; it's a sign of growth. Like molting, but for code."* — **Code Evolution Theory, Vol. III**

## What Are Capsule Scrolls?

**Capsule Scrolls** are compact, ritualized markdown artifacts designed to preserve conversation context when hitting the "archive wall" — the point where long development conversations exceed context limits and early decisions risk being lost.

## Directory Structure

```
capsules/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── templates/                   # Template files for different scroll types
│   ├── arc-capsule.md          # Template for conversation arc preservation

├── active/                     # Current active conversation capsules
└── archived/                   # Completed/resolved capsules moved here
```

## Capsule Scroll Format

Each Capsule Scroll captures:

1. **Arc Name** - Descriptive title for the conversation thread
2. **Timeframe** - When the conversation occurred  
3. **Core Decisions** - Key choices and rationale
4. **Key Artifacts & Commits** - Links to relevant code/PRs
5. **Glyphs & Running Jokes** - Cultural context and humor 
6. **Unresolved Threads** - Open questions and TODOs
7. **Re‑entry Spell** - 3-sentence context snapshot for quick understanding

## Usage

### Manual Creation
```bash
# Copy template
cp capsules/templates/arc-capsule.md capsules/active/my-conversation-arc.md

# Edit with conversation details
# Move to archived/ when complete
```

### Automated Creation (via Chronicle Keeper)
When an issue title contains 🧠📜 emoji combination, the Chronicle Keeper automatically generates a Capsule Scroll.

## Integration with TLDL

Capsule Scrolls link to TLDL entries and vice versa, creating a web of preserved development wisdom that survives context truncation and archive walls.

# 📜 Capsule Scrolls — Conversation Context Anchors

> *"Memory is the palace where wisdom lives, but archives are where it survives."* — **Chronicle Keeper's Manual, Vol. II**

## Purpose

Capsule Scrolls preserve conversation threads and development contexts that extend beyond the "archive wall" — the point where conversation history becomes inaccessible. Each scroll captures the essence of a development arc, making it possible to resurrect context and continue seamlessly.

## Structure

Each Capsule Scroll follows this format:

### **Arc Name** 
The thematic title of the development period or conversation thread.

### **Timeframe**
Start and end dates, or ongoing status.

### **Core Decisions**
Key technical, architectural, or process decisions made during this arc.

### **Key Artifacts & Commits**
Links to issues, PRs, commits, and other tangible outputs.

### **Glyphs & Running Jokes**
Cultural elements, terminology, and humor that provide conversational context.

### **Unresolved Threads**
Open questions, pending decisions, or incomplete work that carries forward.

### **Re-entry Spell** 
A 3-sentence tone/context snapshot that enables instant scene reset for future conversations.

## Automation

Capsule Scrolls can be generated:
- **Automatically**: Via Chronicle Keeper triggers when conversations reach certain thresholds
- **Manually**: Using the `capsule-scroll` CLI command
- **On Archive**: When conversation threads are about to be truncated

## Integration

- **TLDL Entries**: Each Capsule Scroll can spawn related TLDL entries
- **Daily Ledger**: Referenced in daily exports for continuity
- **Chronicle Keeper**: Automatic generation when 🧠📜 triggers are detected
