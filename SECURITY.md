# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Living Dev Agent Template Security

This document outlines the security policies and procedures for the Living Dev Agent Template, built from Jerry Meyer's revolutionary MetVanDAMN debugging innovations.

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Immediate Action Required

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** share vulnerability details in public forums or social media
3. **DO** report the vulnerability through our secure channels (see below)

### Secure Reporting Channels

#### Primary Channel: GitHub Security Advisories
- Go to the repository's Security tab
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Fill out the private vulnerability report form
- Include as much detail as possible

#### Alternative Channel: Email
- Send details to: `security@living-dev-agent.dev` (if available)
- Use PGP encryption if possible
- Include "[SECURITY]" in the subject line

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide the following information:

- **Vulnerability Type**: What kind of security issue is it?
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the template are affected?
- **Attack Vector**: How could this vulnerability be exploited?
- **Impact Assessment**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce (if safe to do so)
- **Suggested Fix**: Any ideas for remediation (optional)

## 🕰️ Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to this timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: 30 days after fix deployment (coordinated disclosure)

## 🔍 Security Scope

### In Scope

The following components are covered by this security policy:

#### Core Template Components
- **Validation tools** (`src/SymbolicLinter/`, `src/DebugOverlayValidation/`)
- **Console Commentary system** (`src/ConsoleCommentary/`)
- **Code Snapshot system** (`src/CodeSnapshot/`)
- **TaskMaster suite** (`src/TaskMaster/`, `src/TimeTracking/`)
- **Setup scripts** (`scripts/`)
- **CI/CD workflows** (`.github/workflows/`)

#### Security-Relevant Areas
- Input validation in Python scripts
- File system operations
- Command execution in shell scripts
- Configuration file parsing
- Data serialization/deserialization
- Session management
- Access controls

### Out of Scope

The following are **NOT** covered by this security policy:

- Third-party dependencies (report to their respective maintainers)
- User's specific implementations using the template
- Infrastructure hosting the repository (GitHub's responsibility)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Template Users

#### Secure Setup
```bash
# Verify script integrity before execution
sha256sum scripts/init_agent_context.sh

# Use least privilege when running scripts
chmod +x scripts/init_agent_context.sh  # Don't use chmod 777

# Review scripts before execution
cat scripts/init_agent_context.sh | less
```

#### Configuration Security
- **Never commit sensitive data** to TLDL entries or configuration files
- **Use environment variables** for secrets and API keys
- **Regularly update dependencies**: `pip install -U -r scripts/requirements.txt`
- **Review generated files** before committing to version control

#### File Permissions
```bash
# Secure file permissions for sensitive files
chmod 600 *.key *.pem  # Private keys
chmod 644 *.md *.py    # Documentation and code
chmod 755 scripts/*.sh # Executable scripts only
```

### For Template Contributors

#### Code Security Guidelines
- **Input validation**: Always validate user inputs and file paths
- **Path traversal prevention**: Use `pathlib.Path` and validate relative paths
- **Command injection prevention**: Use `subprocess` with proper argument lists
- **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries (if applicable)
- **XSS prevention**: Sanitize any HTML/markdown output

#### Review Requirements
- All shell scripts must be reviewed by at least one other contributor
- Python code handling file operations requires security review
- Configuration changes affecting default permissions require approval
- CI/CD workflow changes require maintainer approval

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Before Each Release

- [ ] **Dependency scan**: Run `safety check` and review results
- [ ] **Static analysis**: Run `bandit` security linter
- [ ] **Permission audit**: Verify file permissions are appropriate
- [ ] **Secret scan**: Ensure no hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] **Input validation**: Test with malicious inputs
- [ ] **Path traversal**: Test file operations with `../` paths
- [ ] **Command injection**: Test shell script parameters

### Monthly Security Tasks

- [ ] **Update dependencies**: Update Python packages and GitHub Actions
- [ ] **Review access**: Audit repository collaborators and permissions
- [ ] **Scan for secrets**: Run comprehensive secret scanning tools
- [ ] **Check for new CVEs**: Review security advisories for dependencies
- [ ] **Update documentation**: Keep security guidance current

## 🛠️ Security Tools Integration

### Automated Security Scanning

The template includes automated security scanning in CI/CD:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml includes:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Safety)
- Static security analysis (Bandit)
- Advanced pattern detection (Semgrep)
- Secret scanning (TruffleHog)
- Configuration security checks
```

### Local Security Testing

```bash
# Run security checks locally
pip install safety bandit semgrep

# Check dependencies
safety check

# Static analysis
bandit -r src/ scripts/

# Advanced patterns
semgrep --config=auto .
```

## 🏆 Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve the template's security.

### Hall of Fame

Security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be:
- Listed in our Security Hall of Fame (with permission)
- Credited in release notes for fixes
- Offered the opportunity to review fixes before deployment

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer monetary rewards, but we greatly appreciate:
- Detailed vulnerability reports
- Suggested fixes or improvements
- Responsible disclosure practices

### Jerry's Security Philosophy

> "Security isn't about being paranoid - it's about being prepared. Every line of code is a potential entry point, and every debugging session is an opportunity to strengthen our defenses. The Bootstrap Sentinel protects not just code, but the developers who write it."

## 🔄 Policy Updates

This security policy will be reviewed and updated:
- **Quarterly**: Regular review and updates
- **After incidents**: Updates based on lessons learned
- **Community feedback**: Improvements suggested by users
- **Industry changes**: Adaptation to new security standards

### Change Log

- **2025-01-15**: Initial security policy established

## 📞 Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Reports**: Use GitHub Security Advisories or email `security@living-dev-agent.dev`
- **General Security Questions**: Create a GitHub Discussion in the Security category
- **Policy Questions**: Open a GitHub issue with the `security-policy` label

## 🧙‍♂️ Bootstrap Sentinel's Security Wisdom

*"In the realm of code, security is not a feature to be added - it is the foundation upon which all epic adventures are built. Every vulnerability prevented is a quest completed, every secure practice adopted is an achievement unlocked. The Bootstrap Sentinel stands guard, not just over code, but over the dreams and aspirations of every developer who trusts in our template."*

**Remember**: Security is everyone's responsibility. Whether you're a template user, contributor, or maintainer, your vigilance helps protect the entire community.
