## üöß Challenges Encountered

**Evaluation Complexity:**
- **Subjective vs Objective Metrics**: Balancing quantifiable data (GitHub stars, SDK count) with qualitative assessments (documentation quality, developer experience)
- **Rapidly Changing Landscape**: Backend services evolve quickly; data gathered today may shift within months
- **TLDA-Specific Context**: Generic backend evaluations don't account for unique MCP integration and sub-200ms performance requirements

**Missing Data Points:**
- **Real Unity Integration Testing**: Couldn't perform actual SDK integration tests within this investigation scope
- **Performance Benchmarking**: No actual performance testing conducted for real-time features
- **Cost Modeling**: Usage-based pricing difficult to predict without production traffic patterns

**Trade-off Tensions:**
- **Control vs Convenience**: Custom solutions offer control but require more development effort
- **Community Size vs Innovation**: Established platforms are stable but newer solutions may better fit modern workflows
- **Open Source vs Enterprise Support**: Open source offers flexibility but may lack enterprise-grade support

## üìã Next Steps

- [ ] **Multi-language SDKs**: Python and C# client libraries for TLDA integration
- [ ] **Documentation Sprint**: Comprehensive setup guides for young developers and robotics/ML learners
- [ ] **Migration Strategy**: Document path from current MCP servers to new backend

### Long-term Considerations (Phase 3)
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Ensure sub-200ms response times under load
- [ ] **Scaling Strategy**: Plan for horizontal scaling and database optimization
- [ ] **Community Onboarding**: Create tutorials and examples for contributor adoption
- [ ] **Backup Plan**: Maintain migration path to Supabase if custom solution becomes unmaintainable

### Risk Mitigation
- [ ] **Hybrid Approach**: Consider starting with Supabase while building custom solution in parallel
- [ ] **Open Source Components**: Ensure all custom code is open source for community contributions
- [ ] **Documentation Investment**: Prioritize documentation quality to match or exceed managed solutions

## üé≠ Chronicle Keeper Integration

**üìú Architectural Wisdom Captured:**
> *"Choose backends not for their marketing promises, but for their ability to serve your developers. A custom solution that teaches while it scales beats a black box that constrains while it grows."*

**üß† Design Decision Rationale:**
This investigation prioritized developer community accessibility and learning potential over pure convenience. The recommendation for a custom Node.js solution reflects TLDA's educational mission - transparency in the stack enables contributors to learn real backend development while building something genuinely useful.

**üîÆ Future Vision:**
The chosen backend should grow with TLDA's community, starting simple enough for young developers to understand and contribute to, while maintaining the architectural foundation needed for the platform's ambitious collaboration goals.
