## Discoveries

### [Filling in a form is faster]
- **Key Finding**: Filling in the wizard is more comfortable than editing the template or using a terminal.
- **Impact**: Significant QoL improvement for keepers of the Buttsafe way.
- **Evidence**: Faster authoring with guided fields and immediate preview.
- **Root Cause**: Manual editing friction; desire for an easier path.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Primary usage is inside Unity; editor tooling makes capture habitual.

### [Text wrapping needed]
- **Key Finding**: Long text didn’t wrap; the UI introduced horizontal scrolling.
- **Impact**: Uncomfortable authoring experience.
- **Evidence**: Live testing while writing this entry.
- **Root Cause**: Text areas not using a wrapping style for narrative fields.

## Actions Taken

1. **Tested the new TLDL Wizard**
   - **What**: Opened the wizard in Unity and authored this entry end-to-end.
   - **Why**: Validate UX and capture friction points.
   - **How**: Tools → Living Dev Agent → TLDL Wizard; filled the form and created the file.
   - **Result**: Identified wrapping and minor menu duplication issues; overall flow was natural.
   - **Files Changed**: Editor/TLDLWizardWindow.cs

## Technical Details

### Code Changes
- Added multi-line fields with guidance.
- Added add/remove Discoveries and Actions (foldouts).
- Added toggles to include/exclude sections (Dependencies, Code, Terminal Proof, etc.).
- Added Preview tab with Raw and Wrapped modes.
- Standardized Unity menu path (avoid duplicate top-level menu).
- Output path: Assets/Plugins/living-dev-agent/docs/TLDL-YYYY-MM-DD-<Title>.md

### Dependencies
- Uses built-in .NET/UnityEditor APIs only; no extra packages.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- The form was functional and mostly enjoyable to use.

### What Could Be Improved
- Enable text wrapping for narrative fields to avoid horizontal scrolling.
- Keep code/config fields monospaced and non-wrapped for readability.

### Knowledge Gaps Identified
- UI polish needs real-world usage to surface friction quickly.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
- [x] Clamp/wrap narrative text within the window width (done).
- [ ] Keep a clean single top-level menu (standardize all menu paths).

### Medium-term Actions (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Support embedded images/diagrams in entries.
- [ ] Add issue-template style presets in the wizard.

### Long-term Considerations (Low Priority)
- [ ] Consider tabbed sub-forms for large entries.
- [ ] Optional rendered Markdown preview (toggleable rich view).
