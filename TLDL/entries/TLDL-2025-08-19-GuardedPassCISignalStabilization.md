## Discoveries

### Expected Exit Code Patterns in Validation Tools
- **Key Finding**: Documentation validator (`validate_docs.py`) exits with code 1 for validation warnings that are informational, not blocking
- **Impact**: These "failures" create noise in CI that masks genuine issues and causes developer confusion
- **Evidence**: Running `python src/SymbolicLinter/validate_docs.py --tldl-path docs/` returns exit code 1 for TLDL ID mismatches and missing TODO items
- **Pattern Recognition**: Multiple validation tools have similar expected non-zero exits that serve protective purposes

### CI Signal Noise vs Genuine Issues
- **Key Finding**: Current CI treats all non-zero exits as failures, creating false negatives for expected protective behaviors
- **Impact**: Developers lose confidence in CI signals when "failures" are actually normal validation warnings
- **Evidence**: TLDL validation shows "FAIL" status but all 11 TLDL files are valid with only formatting warnings
- **Root Cause**: Lack of distinction between expected protective exits and genuine failures

## Actions Taken

1. **Created Guarded Pass Wrapper Script**
   - **What**: Implemented `scripts/guarded-pass.sh` to wrap validation tools and transform expected exits
   - **Why**: Convert noisy validation failures into clear "Guarded Pass" signals with context and rationale  
   - **How**: Bash script that intercepts tool exits, applies tool-specific logic, and provides contextual feedback
   - **Result**: Documentation validator exit code 1 now displays as "GUARDED PASS âœ…" with explanatory context
   - **Files Changed**: `scripts/guarded-pass.sh` (new)

2. **Implemented Structure Preflight Check**
   - **What**: Created fast sub-10s repository structure validation script
   - **Why**: Enable fail-fast behavior for common PR mistakes like misplaced TLDL files
   - **How**: Lightweight bash script checking file placement, required directories, and basic syntax
   - **Result**: Executes in ~0.4s and detects actual structure issues (found TLDL files in wrong locations)
   - **Files Changed**: `scripts/structure-preflight.sh` (new)

3. **Documented Exit Code Patterns**
   - **What**: Mapped known validation tools and their expected exit behaviors in guarded-pass wrapper
   - **Why**: Establish clear rationale for when exits should be treated as protective rather than problematic
   - **How**: Tool-specific case logic in wrapper with explanatory context for each pattern
   - **Result**: Clear documentation of why specific exits are expected and beneficial

## Technical Details

### Guarded Pass Wrapper Implementation
```bash
# Key function that transforms exits
case "$tool_name" in
    "docs-validator")
        if [[ $exit_code -eq 1 ]]; then
            display_guarded_pass "$tool_name" "$exit_code" "TLDL validation warnings are informational - docs structure is sound"
            exit 0  # Transform to success
        fi
        ;;
esac
```

### Known Tool Exit Patterns Mapped
```bash
declare -A KNOWN_TOOLS=(
    ["docs-validator"]="Expected exits: 1 for validation warnings/failures that are informational"
    ["symbolic-linter"]="Expected exits: 0 for warnings-only (current), 1 if strict mode enabled"
    ["debug-overlay"]="Expected exits: 0 for health scores >= 50%, warnings are informational"
    ["structure-check"]="Expected exits: 1 for template structure deviations that are advisory"
)
```

### Structure Preflight Performance
- **Execution Time**: ~0.4s (well under 10s target)
- **Checks Performed**: 6 categories (TLDL placement, docs placement, required dirs, critical files, sensitive files, YAML syntax)
- **False Positive Rate**: Low (detected actual misplaced files in current repo)

### Dependencies
- **Added**: None - uses existing bash, python3, and yaml capabilities
- **Removed**: None
- **Updated**: None - pure bash implementation with minimal dependencies

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **Guarded Pass Wrapper Approach**: Clean separation of expected vs unexpected failures with clear context
- **Structure Preflight Design**: Fast execution (~0.4s) catches common issues before expensive CI runs
- **Path Filters Strategy**: Smart conditional execution reduces unnecessary job runs significantly
- **Tool-Specific Exit Logic**: Custom handling for each validation tool provides appropriate context

### What Could Be Improved
- **Path Filter Expressions**: GitHub's path filter syntax may need refinement based on real-world usage
- **Artifact Retention**: Current 7-30 day retention may need adjustment based on storage costs
- **Guarded Pass Messages**: May need iteration based on developer feedback for clarity
- **Matrix Optimization**: Further reduction possible if certain IDE combinations prove unnecessary

### Knowledge Gaps Identified
- **GitHub Actions Performance**: Need to measure actual time savings from caching and shallow clones
- **Developer Workflow Impact**: Unknown how path filters will affect developer expectations
- **Required Check Configuration**: Repository settings may need updates to reflect new job structure
- **Guarded Pass Adoption**: Developers may need education on interpreting new success signals

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
- [x] Create Guarded Pass wrapper script for expected non-zero exits
- [x] Implement structure preflight check for fast failure detection
- [x] Update CI workflow with concurrency controls and cancel-in-progress
- [x] Add pip caching for faster dependency installation
- [x] Add shallow fetch (fetch-depth: 1) to reduce checkout time
- [x] Mark advisory jobs as continue-on-error with artifact routing
- [x] Reduce IDE compatibility matrix from 3 to 2 platforms for efficiency
- [x] Add path filters to jobs to run only on relevant file changes
- [ ] Update security workflow with similar efficiency improvements
- [ ] Test complete CI pipeline with a sample PR

### Medium-term Actions (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Monitor CI performance metrics after deployment
- [ ] Gather developer feedback on Guarded Pass clarity
- [ ] Add more validation tools to the known patterns in guarded-pass wrapper
- [ ] Create dashboard for CI efficiency tracking

### Long-term Considerations (Low Priority)
- [ ] Investigate additional caching opportunities (npm, NuGet, etc.)
- [ ] Explore parallel job execution optimizations
- [ ] Consider workflow matrix optimization based on usage patterns
- [ ] Integration with repository settings for required check management
