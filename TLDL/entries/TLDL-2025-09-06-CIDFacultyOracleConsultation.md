## Faculty Consultation Results

### Future Sight - The Oracle

> Strategic forecasting reveals 3 possible futures over 90-day horizon Scenario probability range: 15% - 60% Primary pathways: Steady ascent, Monetization spike & strain, Fragmented forks Each scenario includes trajectory, prerequisites, risks, and leading indicators Strategic decisions require balancing growth opportunities with operational constraints

#### Strategic Scenarios

**1. Steady ascent** (60% probability)
- **Timeline**: 90 days
- **Description**: undefined
- **Prerequisites**: Genre templates shipped, CODEOWNERS enforced, XP telemetry visible
- **Key Risks**: Docs drift across genres, review bottlenecks for monetization changes

**2. Monetization spike & strain** (25% probability)
- **Timeline**: 90 days
- **Description**: undefined
- **Prerequisites**: Public verify endpoint, rate limits + issuance audit trail, on‚Äëcall reviewer rota
- **Key Risks**: Fraud attempts on badge issuance, CI queue saturation

**3. Fragmented forks** (15% probability)
- **Timeline**: 90 days
- **Description**: undefined
- **Prerequisites**: Clear licensing + trademark guidance, compatibility kit + 'Official Module' registry
- **Key Risks**: Brand dilution, support ambiguity

## Discoveries

### Strategic Forecast (Oracle)
- **Forecast Horizon**: 6-month strategic outlook
- **Scenario Analysis**: 3 possible futures evaluated
- **High-Probability Paths**: 2 scenarios with >60% likelihood
- **Risk Assessment**: Each scenario includes prerequisite and risk analysis

## Actions Taken

1. **Faculty Consultation Executed**
   - **What**: Oracle consultation for strategic forecasting and scenario planning
   - **Why**: Provide evidence-based recommendations and strategic direction
