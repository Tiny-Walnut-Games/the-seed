- Author: Warbler AI Project Intelligence + Gemma3
- Context: AI-powered project generation for tower-defense
- Summary: Complete project created from natural language request
- Tags: project-setup, warbler-generated, tower-defense, strategy, grid-system, pathfinding

## Objective
**User Request:** "Create a tower defense game"
**AI Interpretation:** tower-defense (complex complexity)

## AI Analysis Results
### Game Type Detection
- **Type:** tower-defense
- **Complexity:** complex 
- **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks
- **Architecture:** ECS with ScriptableObject data

### Generated Systems
- **GridSystem.cs**: AI-generated gridsystem implementation
- **TowerPlacement.cs**: AI-generated towerplacement implementation
- **TowerUpgrade.cs**: AI-generated towerupgrade implementation
- **EnemyPathfinding.cs**: AI-generated enemypathfinding implementation
- **WaveSpawner.cs**: AI-generated wavespawner implementation
- **ResourceManager.cs**: AI-generated resourcemanager implementation
- **ProjectileSystem.cs**: AI-generated projectilesystem implementation
- **TargetingSystem.cs**: AI-generated targetingsystem implementation

### Key Mechanics Identified
- grid-based placement
- pathfinding AI
- tower targeting
- resource management
- wave progression
- tower upgrades
- strategic planning

### Folder Structure Created
- Scripts/Grid/
- Scripts/Towers/
- Scripts/Enemies/
- Scripts/Pathfinding/
- Scripts/Managers/
- Scripts/UI/
- Scripts/Economy/

## Development Roadmap
1. Grid system and basic placement (Week 1-2)
2. Pathfinding and enemy movement (Week 3-4)
3. Tower systems and targeting (Week 5-6)
4. Economy and progression (Week 7)
5. Balance and polish (Week 8)

## Testing Strategy
- Pathfinding stress testing
- Tower placement validation
- Economic balance testing
- Performance with multiple units

## Warbler Insights
Tower Defense requires robust pathfinding, efficient grid systems, and balanced economic progression. Focus on modular tower design.

## Next Steps
1. **Review Generated Code**: Examine AI-generated scripts for customization opportunities
2. **Create Prefabs**: Build game objects based on generated system architecture
3. **Configure Scenes**: Set up game scenes according to requirements
4. **Test Integration**: Validate system interactions and performance
5. **Customize & Polish**: Adapt generated code to specific game vision
