## Faculty Consultation Results

### Present Wisdom - The Advisor

> Monetization posture: Badge registry + anti‚Äëtheft primitives are central; enforce perk immutability and lineage checks in CI for trust. Learning loop: TLDL-powered rituals are strong; codify 'XP-for-docs' telemetry and surface contributor progress in README badges. Operational risk: Repo sprawl across genres risks docs drift; establish genre pack templates and a single source of truth. Pipeline hygiene: Lock down Action permissions, pin actions, and require CODEOWNERS reviews for monetization and badge areas. Community runway: Shape a 'Schoolhouse' track: quickstart quests, example PRs, and Faculty badges to accelerate first‚Äëtime contributors.

#### Prioritized Action Items

**1. Perk immutability guardrails in CI** (High impact, Medium effort)
- **Description**: Add schema checks + signed manifest verification for perks; block changes outside approved migration scripts.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: security
- **Priority Score**: 95

**2. Genre pack templates** (High impact, Medium effort)
- **Description**: Provide starter docs, quests, and XP tables per genre; DRY via a common template folder and symlink or generator.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: documentation
- **Priority Score**: 90

**3. Badge registry integrity checks** (High impact, Low effort)
- **Description**: Verify badge IDs, signatures, and issuance logs on PR; publish a public verify endpoint/readme snippet.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: security
- **Priority Score**: 88

**4. Contributor 'First Quest' path** (Medium impact, Low effort)
- **Description**: A single labeled issue + sample PR that walks through docs XP, commit rituals, and Faculty stamps.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: community
- **Priority Score**: 75

**5. Actions hardening** (High impact, Low effort)
- **Description**: `permissions: contents: read`, `pull-requests: write` only where needed; pin SHA for all actions; restrict reusable workflows by `workflow_call`.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: security
- **Priority Score**: 85

**6. XP telemetry surface** (Medium impact, Medium effort)
- **Description**: Emit XP and completeness scores to a JSON artifact; render shields in README and per‚ÄëPR comments.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: gamification
- **Priority Score**: 70

**7. TLDL templates v2** (Medium impact, Low effort)
- **Description**: Add 'Present Wisdom' and 'Future Sight' sections with checklists and CID stamps.
- **Evidence**: undefined
- **Category**: documentation
- **Priority Score**: 65

### Future Sight - The Oracle

> Strategic forecasting reveals 3 possible futures over 90-day horizon Scenario probability range: 15% - 60% Primary pathways: Steady ascent, Monetization spike & strain, Fragmented forks Each scenario includes trajectory, prerequisites, risks, and leading indicators Strategic decisions require balancing growth opportunities with operational constraints

#### Strategic Scenarios

**1. Steady ascent** (60% probability)
- **Timeline**: 90 days
- **Description**: undefined
- **Prerequisites**: Genre templates shipped, CODEOWNERS enforced, XP telemetry visible
- **Key Risks**: Docs drift across genres, review bottlenecks for monetization changes

**2. Monetization spike & strain** (25% probability)
- **Timeline**: 90 days
- **Description**: undefined
- **Prerequisites**: Public verify endpoint, rate limits + issuance audit trail, on‚Äëcall reviewer rota
- **Key Risks**: Fraud attempts on badge issuance, CI queue saturation

**3. Fragmented forks** (15% probability)
- **Timeline**: 90 days
- **Description**: undefined
- **Prerequisites**: Clear licensing + trademark guidance, compatibility kit + 'Official Module' registry
- **Key Risks**: Brand dilution, support ambiguity

2. **Present-State Audit (Advisor)**
   - **What**: Repository health assessment and improvement prioritization
   - **Why**: Identify immediate opportunities and quick wins
   - **How**: Evidence-based analysis across 2 categories
   - **Result**: 7 prioritized action items with effort/impact ratings

3. **Strategic Forecasting (Oracle)**
   - **What**: Multi-scenario future planning and risk assessment
   - **Why**: Enable proactive strategic decision making
   - **How**: Probability-weighted scenario analysis with prerequisite mapping
   - **Result**: 3 strategic pathways with leading indicators

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Advisor Recommendations)
- [ ] **Perk immutability guardrails in CI**: Add schema checks + signed manifest verification for perks; block changes outside approved migration scripts. (Medium effort)
- [ ] **Genre pack templates**: Provide starter docs, quests, and XP tables per genre; DRY via a common template folder and symlink or generator. (Medium effort)
- [ ] **Badge registry integrity checks**: Verify badge IDs, signatures, and issuance logs on PR; publish a public verify endpoint/readme snippet. (Low effort)

### Strategic Preparation (Oracle Guidance)
- [ ] **Prepare for Steady ascent**: Focus on Genre templates shipped and CODEOWNERS enforced
