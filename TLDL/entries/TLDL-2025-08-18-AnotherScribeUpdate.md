## Discoveries

### [Bug 🐛]
- **Key Finding**: Wrapped view mode is not the same size as the first markdown view. It only decends about halfway down the window
- **Impact**: Mild annoyance to the Cheekdom.

## Actions Taken

1. **[Tested the fix for the Scribe]**
   - **What**: Tested the update
   - **Why**: Determine functionality and completeness
   - **How**: By using the form
   - **Result**: Found further improvements could be made.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
- [ ] Deprecate wrapped view mode.
- [ ] Wrap the text in raw view mode by default.
- [ ] Add a vertical scrollbar for the raw view as one does not currently show.

### Medium-term Actions (Medium Priority)
- [ ] See previous logs...
- [ ] Clear the form on submission.
- [ ] Document explorer. Specially if a Gitbook style documentation directory has been set-up? That would be awesome.
- [ ] Providing an index of logs within a panel to the left of the Scribe's form
