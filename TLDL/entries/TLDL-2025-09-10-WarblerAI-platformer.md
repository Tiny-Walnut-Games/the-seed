## Metadata
- Entry ID: TLDL-2025-09-10-WarblerAI-platformer
- Author: Warbler AI Project Intelligence + Gemma3
- Context: AI-powered project generation for platformer
- Summary: Complete project created from natural language request
- Tags: project-setup, warbler-generated, platformer, physics, level-design, collectibles

## Objective
**User Request:** "Create a 2D platformer with collectibles"
**AI Interpretation:** platformer (moderate complexity)

## AI Analysis Results
### Game Type Detection
- **Type:** platformer
- **Complexity:** moderate 
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
- **Architecture:** Component-based with State Machines

### Generated Systems
- **PlayerMovement.cs**: AI-generated playermovement implementation
- **JumpController.cs**: AI-generated jumpcontroller implementation
- **PlatformController.cs**: AI-generated platformcontroller implementation
- **EnemyAI.cs**: AI-generated enemyai implementation
- **CollectibleSystem.cs**: AI-generated collectiblesystem implementation
- **LevelManager.cs**: AI-generated levelmanager implementation
- **CheckpointSystem.cs**: AI-generated checkpointsystem implementation
- **CameraController.cs**: AI-generated cameracontroller implementation

### Key Mechanics Identified
- precise jumping
- physics-based movement
- enemy collisions
- collectible gathering
- level progression
- checkpoint system

### Folder Structure Created
- Scripts/Player/
- Scripts/Enemies/
- Scripts/Platforms/
- Scripts/Collectibles/
- Scripts/Managers/
- Scripts/UI/
- Scripts/Environment/

## Development Roadmap
1. Player movement and jumping (Week 1-2)
2. Basic level design and platforms (Week 3)
3. Enemies and collision systems (Week 4)
4. Collectibles and progression (Week 5)
5. Polish and level creation (Week 6)

## Testing Strategy
- Physics consistency testing
- Control responsiveness validation
- Level completion playtesting
- Edge case collision testing

## Warbler Insights
Platformers require precise controls, consistent physics, and well-designed level progression. Focus on player feel and responsive input.

## Next Steps
1. **Review Generated Code**: Examine AI-generated scripts for customization opportunities
2. **Create Prefabs**: Build game objects based on generated system architecture
3. **Configure Scenes**: Set up game scenes according to requirements
4. **Test Integration**: Validate system interactions and performance
5. **Customize & Polish**: Adapt generated code to specific game vision
