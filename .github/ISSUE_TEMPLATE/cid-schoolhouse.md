## Scope
- What should the CID study first?
  - [ ] Repo-wide
  - [ ] Specific area: (path/glob)
  - [ ] Recent activity: (last N commits, PR #, Issue #)

## Goals
- **Primary questions:** What do we want the critique to answer?
- **Desired outcomes:** e.g., automation ideas, doc gaps, CI hardening, badge opportunities.

## Constraints
- **Time budget:** e.g., 10–15 min pass.
- **File fences:** paths to skip (secrets, large bins).
- **Privacy notes:** proprietary bits to avoid citing verbatim.

## Output format
- [ ] Executive TLDL (5 bullets)
- [ ] Findings (Evidence-linked)
- [ ] Critique (Gaps, risks)
- [ ] Proposals (1–3 per category with effort/impact)
- [ ] Auto-issues (optional)
- [ ] Badge timeline (CID stamps)

## Triggers
- The 🎓 emoji and label `cid:schoolhouse` invoke the workflow.
- Comment triggers:
  - `TLDL: …` for a short executive summary
  - `📝 add-issues` to fan out proposals as GitHub issues

## Acceptance
- [ ] Comment posted with critique
- [ ] TLDL entry written and indexed
- [ ] CID badge stamps applied
