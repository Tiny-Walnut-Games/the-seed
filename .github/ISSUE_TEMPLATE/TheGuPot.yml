        ## üî¨ Purpose
        Single template for the entire lifecycle: raw fragment ‚Üí narrative validation ‚Üí micro‚Äëexperiment ‚Üí field report ‚Üí graduation or compost.

        Use iterative edits instead of opening new issues. Preserve lineage in the History section.

        Stages: `larva` ‚Üí `fermenting` ‚Üí `distilled` ‚Üí `serum` (validated) ‚Üí `antitoxin` (neutralizes recurring toxic pattern) ‚Üí `compost` (archived but explain why).

        ### Promotion Rules
        - To move to fermenting: Must have logline + antagonist + stakes.
        - To move to distilled: All readiness gate checkboxes satisfied.
        - To move to serum: Field report completed with residue artifacts committed.
        - To become antitoxin: Demonstrated neutralization of at least one recurring toxic pattern.
        - Compost only with explicit reason (supports future archeology).

        ### Editing Guidance
        - Prefer additive history entries over silent rewrites.
        - Keep logline stable once distilled; changes after that may indicate story fracture ‚Üí reassess.

        ### Reminder
        If you cannot express: Protagonist wants X but Y blocks it, so Z changes the world producing residue R, the idea returns to the jar.

        Happy incubating. üß™
