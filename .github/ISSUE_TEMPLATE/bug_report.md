- Use `TLDL: [insight]` in comments to preserve specific wisdom
- Use `ðŸ“œ [lesson learned]` to mark content for scroll preservation

**Example:**
```
TLDL: The memory leak only occurred when using the debug overlay in production 
builds. Root cause: conditional compilation flags weren't properly excluding 
debug allocations in release mode.
```
