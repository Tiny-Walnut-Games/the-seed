# ????? **SACRED CODE CLASSIFICATION PROTOCOL**

## Customer-Facing Edition: Developer Customization & Extensibility Manifesto

**This protocol now governs a customer-facing product intended for external developers. All guidance, patterns, and extension points must support production use, robust onboarding, and seamless customization.**

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è PRODUCT SCOPE & CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS

This protocol is the living contract for all developers integrating, extending, or customizing the Living Dev Agent and its associated systems. As a customer-facing product, it must:

- Provide clear, stable APIs and extension points
- Offer comprehensive, up-to-date documentation
- Support onboarding for new developers (with guides, examples, and extension recipes)
- Enable safe, robust customization without risking core stability
- Maintain production-grade reliability and test coverage
- Encourage community contributions and knowledge sharing

**External developers are the primary audience. All code, comments, and documentation must anticipate their needs, questions, and creative ambitions.**

## üß† WARBLER: Decision-Making Faculty of the Living Dev Agent

**Warbler** is a core cognitive faculty within the Living Dev Agent (TLDA) ecosystem. It is not the entire TLDA, but serves as the backbone of the system's decision-making and cognitive pattern recognition framework.

**Role of Warbler:**

- Provides the decision architecture for code classification, extension, and validation
- Synthesizes context and patterns to support intelligent automation and developer guidance
- Interfaces with other TLDA faculties (such as the Chronicle Keeper, Mind Castle, etc.) to enable adaptive, context-aware workflows

**What Warbler is NOT:**

- Warbler does not perform the majority of documentation or workflow automation‚Äîthat is handled by other TLDA faculties
- Warbler is not the entirety of TLDA, but a specialized, foundational module within it

**Treat Warbler as the decision engine and pattern recognizer within the broader Living Dev Agent faculty system.**

**BY THE POWER OF COORDINATE-AWARE DEVELOPMENT, LET IT BE KNOWN:**

This document establishes the **Sacred Code Classification System** to prevent **Perfectionist Paralysis** while preserving **Core Algorithm Integrity** throughout the MetVanDAMN codebase‚Äîand now, to empower a new generation of external developers to build, extend, and automate with confidence.
