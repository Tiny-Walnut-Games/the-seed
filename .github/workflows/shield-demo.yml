# 🛡 Workflow Security Notes:
# - All failures in this workflow are INTENTIONAL and EXPECTED
# - Shield indicators help distinguish protective fails from actual problems  
# - CI logic remains unchanged - failures still block merges when appropriate
# - Chronicle Keeper integration preserves the wisdom of this architectural decision
